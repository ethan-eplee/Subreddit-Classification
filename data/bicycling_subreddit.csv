Best I can think of is a U lock on the front and back tires attached to the frame and then a third from the wheel to the rack. All that seems a bit excessive. Is there anything more efficient?

bicycling,"Hi all,

In a couple of weeks I'll off on a summer holiday to Austrian Alpes and the road bike is coming along of course for a handful of 30-80km rides (depending on gradient of terrain). I'm just wondering which is the smarter option?

1) My entry level Sensa Romagna (alu frame, carbon fork, tubes, rim brakes, 9 speed Sora, Campa Zonda wheels, Pirelli Cinturato tubes, 9-9.2kg listed weight).

2) My mid range Giant TCR Advanced (full carbon, tubeless,11 speed 105, hydraulic discs, 8.4kg listed weight).

I'll have get a new 11-32 or 11-34 casette regardless of the bike of choice, which will probably end on a shelve in the garage waiting for another time when I'll do a hilly ride. 9 speed cassettes are roughly € 20-35, 11 speed start at €80.

Pros of the entry level: easy maintenance, compact crank, punctures easy to fix, cheap new casette
Cons of entry level: rimbrakes, only 9 speed, not as fast/lightweight, tubes so more risk of punctures 

Pros of the Giant: tubeless, fast and lightweight, disc brakes, 11speed
Cons of the Giant: no experience with tubeless punctures, expensive cassette that won't get a lot use afterwards.

She used to ride it everywhere instead of driving and hasn't replaced it yet.. she's very thrifty. Her birthday is coming up and I'm looking at some used, as I could not afford to drop 3-6 grand off the cuff for one for her unfortunately. She's been biking habitually like that for many years, I can tell she misses it. She's owned a few over the years, and always bought used. She's about 5'7"" with a very muscular/thick lower thighs and rear end.

bicycling,"Hi everyone. It´s been a while since I started riding my bike directly on second gear. I decided to do this because I started a new job and it consumes a lot of time in which I used to ride my bike a lot, so I wanted to keep a bit of that excercise and thought it would be a good idea to ride it in heavier gears, so as not to lose condition.

So anyways yesterday I started riding in third gear and got to thinking that starting off in higher gears could damage the bike in some way, especially since I have to put a lot of stress on the pedal cranks when starting off.

Hey all, so I was getting some knee pain after getting clipless shoes on my first bike. Obviously I had them set up incorrectly, so I thought it was a good idea to get a bike fit. I was also experiencing some neck pain from looking up.


My bike fitter sorted out my cleat positioning, so no more knee pain which is great. He also swapped my stem out to a 60 mm, it is angled up slightly as well as I have mild scoliosis and he wanted me to be more upright on my bike. 

The biggest and most drastic change was my saddle height, he raised it up substantially. 

At first I felt kind of odd but I’ve gotten used to it. The first couple of rides were great.. but now after every ride, even short rides right above my left butt cheek area I am getting some discomfort. I’ve read lowering your saddle can help with hip related pain but I’m not sure if I should go against the bike fitter?

Included below is the email sent from the fitter~

“We started adjusting the cleats in order to guarantee your feet are applying the force in the right spot and prevent them from assuming an unnatural position which may cause issues with the knees in the long term.

As for the saddle, we started adjusting the saddle height looking for a better leg extension preventing your upper knee muscles to get over-compress when they are returning on the pedaling stroke; also, I adjusted the saddle reach to improve the appliance of the force along the pedaling stroke, this adjustment will increase the efficiency on your pedaling stroke. The saddle tilt was lowered accordingly with the new higher and further back saddle position to avoid pressure in your perineal area.

In the front end of the bike we replaced the stem for a shorter and put it in a raiser position to decrease the reach of the bike and to put your spine in a more straight position which will help us with your escoliosis.

I hope these adjustments help you to ride your bike more comfortably and you can enjoy every ride.”",Pain after bike fit,"5ft 8.5 on a size M Revolt 2

Did my first century (100mi/160km) today. My old nemesis, my butt, is as fine as can be. A combination of chamois Creme (assos), quality bibs (sqlab) and a premium saddle (specialized power pro with mirror) are the incredibly combination that finally solved my seating issues. If it was up to my bottom, I could happily continue riding.

My frontal area is not so happy. I have never had this issue with cheap bibs, but since switching to the SQlab ones this started happening. Basically the chamys move the little bit of hair in my crotch area (is it the crotch? The area above the goodies, whatever that's called) up and down as I ride, leading to red irritated skin and sores. Towards the end it started being quite painful. I noticed this on a few earlier rides too, so I applied the creme before the ride today in this area as well. Did not help one bit.

Now, no one asked but it may be helpful: I do not fully shave down there. I have sensitive skin as is, so I really only trim it to a kind of stubble.

Does anyone have any ideas what to do about it?
I will get some Creme to put on it now but how can I avoid it in the future? Also, I was planning on going back on the bike tomorrow, another 140km, no idea how to approach this.

bicycling,"As the topic states, I'm brainstorming about ways that I might be able to make this bike go a bit faster. It's not a huge deal, but recently, I've been doing more mountain biking on my regular bike, and I'd forgotten just how much of a difference things like a bigger frame and larger tires make. I don't think I'll be able to install bigger tires on this errand bike, but I've been wondering about other modifications I might be able to make to get a bit more speed out of the thing.  

So far, I'm debating:  
* Installing road tires. I'd need to adjust the brakes and stuff with the narrower rims, but I think the smaller treads might be worth the hassle.  
* Adjusting gear ratios? I'm not quite sure about this one; it seems like once you're on the maximum gear settings, that might be about all you're gonna get. However, I thought I'd bring it up here out of curiosity.  
* Simply cleaning the thing. I don't know how big of a difference this will make; it doesn't seem all that dirty to me, but I'll probably do a general tuneup just as a general protocol.  

I also added toeclips, although personally, I'm not sure how people could ride ANY bike without these things! Being able to exert pressure on the pedals through 360 degrees seems like a no-brainer. Plus, both potholes and quick accelerations can be borderline dangerous without them.

At first it was pretty obvious I'd bring my Surly Straggler; put some Marathon tires on 'em and don't look back. However, when loaded up (will be traveling with panniers at the back for the first time), the Straggler gets a bit wobbly on descends. Also, I really enjoy the geometry of my Surly ECR, especially for longer rides.

If I were to bring the ECR I'm contemplating putting on a set of 2.5"" Extraterrestrials, or perhaps even a 2.35"" alternative though I feel that's stretching the limits given the 45mm internal width rims.

bicycling,"heres a thought experiment:

You own a 5000$ aero bike. Today you discovered that some evil elves have made your bike 30% less efficient (making it the same speed as a 100$ bike), but hidden a small motor &amp; battery (4kg) in it that perfectly compensates the inefficiency so your bike have the same speed in all conditions. The elves have promised to charge the bike everyday and pay for the electricity cost. They will also help you with 4kg (39.2N) of lift force when you are carrying your bike up stairs.

How much would you care? Would you be happy if the elves gives you 500$ in return? 1000$?  3000$? 4900$? 

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently got this shower thought: 

the differences between cheap and superbikes includes handling, comfort, longevity, weight, braking, and most importantly, speed/efficiency.

when improving speed/efficiency, manufatures are always in for marginal gains (i.e. 10% increase in speed might cost 300% increase in cost)

Therefore, what if a tech startup designs a 500$ bike that have a hidden smart motor which only supplies a little bit of electricity to make it exactly as fast as a 5000$ superbike given the same human effort and condition. I know such a software for emulating the exact speed under difference conditions will be hard but im sure a team of programmer and physicist can figure it out. 

Handling and braking might not be as good but the cheap bike will be upright so more comfort. 

From what I read, a city bike and a TT aero bike can have around 60w of difference in drag in high speed. So lets assume 60w for 2.5 hours a day and 5 day a week. That means a 4kg 745kWh Bosch battery will last you a week (or a full 12 hour day). Electricity cost will be less than 100$ a year (assuming off peak 0.1$/kWh). The only issue I can think of is weight, which wouldn't be much of a problem unless you have to go up and down stairs with the bike.",a teeny tiny blasphemous idea: cheap ebike VS superbike,"heres a thought experiment:

So, I raced him and to my surprise he actually won. I couldn't believe  it. I never liked e-bikes because id honestly rather pedal a bike (bmx &amp; road). So after we raced (100yds or so) I hopped on and and immediately went full speed which surprised the hell out of me as to how quickly they respond, almost like a tesla. I was sold on it, I wanted to buy one asap. I asked him how much he paid for it and he said $4k!! I was shocked they can actually go for that much but it must be in the lithium battery and the tech features...pretty insane though.

So, I raced him and to my surprise he actually won. I couldn't believe  it. I never liked e-bikes because id honestly rather pedal a bike (bmx &amp; road). So after we raced (100yds or so) I hopped on and and immediately went full speed which surprised the hell out of me as to how quickly they respond, almost like a tesla. I was sold on it, I wanted to buy one asap. I asked him how much he paid for it and he said $4k!! I was shocked they can actually go for that much but it must be in the lithium battery and the tech features...pretty insane though.

bicycling,"Hi all, my kiddo needs a new bike. We have a pedal bike with 14"" wheels and brake levers that they are just starting to ride with minimal assistance. But they grew so fast that it's clearly too small, and based on measurements they actually need to jump a few sizes. Every recommendation I get is for a Woom 4, which has 20"" wheels and a shifter too. That seems like a huge leap from 14 -&gt; 20 and I'd be a bit more concerned with falling over because that hasn't been mastered yet.

I could otherwise try a Woom 3 or similar, and raise up the bars to avoid going larger all around until we're ready for 20"" wheels, but I don't know if that's a bad choice. I'm a bike mechanic by hobby, btw.

bicycling,"Hello cyclists!

I just bought [a new bike online](https://www.bike24.com/p2509389.html) after failing to find one in the second hand market and having local shops not having anything of the right type and size for me. It's a bike mostly to commute in a hilly city and for 1-2h trips with a child seat at the back, attached to the seat tube.

My issue is with the size. I'm 180 cm tall and both [the table](https://images.bike24.net/media/366/i/mb/23/33/df/lapierre-shaper-30-disc-geo-1036924.JPG) and the ""find my frame size"" clearly says to order size L with a safe margin, which I did. Even if I was 5 cm taller they would recommend L. The manufacturer [does not provide a size guide.](https://www.lapierrebikes.com/fr-en/o/shaper-30-disc-2022/)

However the frame is 50 cm, and my leg length (with the classical method they describe in the ""find my frame size"" &gt; ""?"" &gt; ""How do I measure my leg length?"" is about 84 cm.

After mounting the bike and adjusting [the saddle height](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh5Zv6Dcn6k), the frame to top of saddle is about 25 cm out, with about 4 cm centimeters before the saddle tube limit. The saddle position is similar to the picture on the website.

From sitting on it against a wall, the position seems comfortable despite the saddle being slightly higher than the handlebar.

My question is: can I expect more comfort if I size up? Could the size guide be that wrong? Does it matter for my usage?

The XL frame is 55cm. The tradeoff I see are:

* Smaller frame: easier to get on bike with child at the back, and already in my home
* Bigger frame: probably better suited to my size?

Hello all,

I would like to get some good advice about picking between these two bikes (or even throwing a 3rd bike into this discussion). My goal is mostly to do endurance biking (80% endurance, 20% climbing).

So I am planning to buy a new road bike but I have a few constraints.

Budget **MAX 5000 USD (if I can stay under even better!)**

Size: **56 / M**

**Must:**

**Electric shifting**

**Disc Brakes**

**Carbon Fiber Frame**

*Wishes:*

*Carbon fiber wheels (but I know within budget is pretty much impossible). -&gt; This I can always buy later.*

So looking at the Domane SL 6 eTap and Endurance CF SL 8 Disc Di2, I really can't decide. I have always had a Trek but they are also so expensive. Looking at the components I would almost say the Endurance has better components but would like to hear from the community. Which one has better components? What would you choose with the budget/constraints?

I have looked on pinkbike and other facebook groups but every person who has my 3 musts wants over 4.5k-5.5k for these bikes. So as much as I want to help the community and buy used, I'd rather even spend 500$ more and have a warranty and buy new.

\*\* I did even think about buying an older bike such as 2020/2021 Domane SL/SLR without electronic shifting or whatever I can find for around 3k and buying SRAM shifters to install. Would buying non-electric and converting to SRAM (since fully wireless and easier I imagine) be a good way to go as well? \*\*

I have looked on pinkbike and other facebook groups but every person who has my 3 musts wants over 4.5k-5.5k for these bikes. So as much as I want to help the community and buy used, I'd rather even spend 500$ more and have a warranty and buy new.

\*\* I did even think about buying an older bike such as 2020/2021 Domane SL/SLR without electronic shifting or whatever I can find for around 3k and buying SRAM shifters to install. Would buying non-electric and converting to SRAM (since fully wireless and easier I imagine) be a good way to go as well? \*\*

To round out my cycling fleet, I recently got a city and hauling bike. I mostly got it for the components, but want to change the fit a bit.
It's a Giant Alltour cs2.

The fit is a little cramped despite the frame size being larger than my usual.

As I enjoy drop bars, I figured why not give that a try. I know that there are microshift bar ends that would work with the nexus hub.

However, I am lost when it comes to brakes.
What do I even look for? I'd want some racing style brakes, as I like riding in the hoods. Are there any without integrated shifters?
And how would they be compatible with the hydraulic discs that are already on the bike? (shimano BR MT200). I  wouldnt mind buying levers and brakes together, but I have no idea what to look for.

bicycling,"Hello all,  


I have been riding for quite a while but I just ride. I don't know anything about bikes themselves. I am now trying to work on my sprint and have some questions about gearing.  


I have a 50 tooth front chainring and was in the 11th small gear in the back. My peak power ever was 1400 when I hit it with all I had at the very *beginning* of a sprint at an extremely low cadence. Just for that instant. However, normally:  


**When I sprint up a slight incline, typical numbers look like:**  
Peak power: 1221  
Cadence at peak power: 95  
Highest cadence reached: 107  


**When I Sprint on flats typical numbers look like:**  
Peak power: 985  
Cadence at peak power: 94  
Highest cadence reached: 104  


My question is, is this a gearing issue, a spinning issue, something else? How can I improve my sprint based on this? Also, any other sprint training tips would be appreciated.

There has been a propensity over the years for hybrid bike manufacturers to increase the width of their flat-bars. Apart from the advantages stated by manufacturers (stability/safety and a more 'open' riding posture allowing one to breathe better), are there any other reasons why this has been happening? I was breathing just fine on my old hybrid. Over the past 10 years, hybrid bike handlebar widths have increased from a standard of 580-620 mm in 2010-2012 to around 680-700 mm in 2021-2022 (for an L sized bike). This is a real performance killer for those of us who want a fast flat-bar as opposed to a drop-bar road bike. Besides, with your wrists so wide apart, it makes one look like a giraffe at a water-hole.

I cut my handlebars back from 690 mm to 650 mm on my 2021 hybrid. I might cut it back a bit more, to around 620 mm. I also flipped the stem from a positive to a zero angle. Made a huge difference.",Hybrid flat-bars getting wider,"Hybrid bikers,

I've had this bike in the family since it was purchased new in 1988. As you can see it's still in excellent condition. 

Note all the 1980s retro goodness, including:

* Aluminum body, stock steel fork and original handlebars
* Flat top bar on one of the stiffest bikes ever made
* All original Shimano 105 components
* 2x6 gearset with the crazy egg-shaped BioPace chainring (designed by computer!)
* Wolber double-walled rims

A decade ago I used it to train for and race a half ironman. Swapped out the pedals for Look Keos and added a tri seat (still have the original white one). Have since removed the aero clip ons, so it's pretty close to stock. Mechanically everything is simple, sturdy and functioning.

Now that kids are older I can get back out for longer rides. My daily driver is a commuter hybrid, so this is just for fitness and fun in the 20-100km ride range. Also pushing 50 so want it to be comfortable. I know that this will never be a $10k Cervelo, but looking for suggestions on how to improve the setup without blowing the bank.

Some thoughts:

* Don't change anything - it's perfect as is
* Wider tires. Currently running 23s. Can definitely fit 25s and *maybe* 28s
* Move the drop shifters up to the stem
* Switch to something like a [Shimano SL-A050](https://www.amazon.com/Shimano-Handlebar-Mount-speed-Shifter/dp/B001L5Y1GC/) (can the right index shifter be modded to friction?)
* Change the handlebars to a more modern/comfortable shape (95% of my riding will be on the hoods or top)

Figure there's no point changing brakes, cassette (non-standard dropout width), wheels or chainring.

I’d love to get some feedback from y’all if you have a moment.


Because I tend to get overly verbose, let’s keep this simple: if you had the chance to change ANYTHING (policy, infrastructure, etc) where you work to benefit and increase bike-ridership, what would you change and why? 

The common rationale is “Oh, bike commuters want showers and a cage to lock up their bikes when they get to work” however in practice I’ve not seen many (if any) justify bicycle commuting because they have a shower or place to park. Hell, I ride 10 miles in to work and when I get there I just park my bike next to my desk and change clothes in the restroom and I’m happy and clean. 


Instead I’m curious if there are policy changes, incentives, or otherwise that would entice (or has worked to entice in your experience) those who currently commute by car to swap over to biking, even if only one day a week. 


Ideas I’ve tossed around - biking incentives such as a per-diem for bike commuting, or getting to arrive late or leave early to account for the (sometimes) extra time spent bicycle commuting. Organizing group rides, bicycle maintenance classes. Building a simple bike “mechanic” stand with the common tools needed to maintain your steed. Discounts from local bike shops/partners. Free transit passes.

I'm beginning training for a few long climbing races in the mountains, and I'm probably going to be purchasing a new (likely used) bike.

I had a shop tell me that on the long descents of a mountain stage race I'd benefit from having disc brakes of some sort (mechanical or hydraulic.)

Currently I have Alexrim aluminium wheels. I would need wheels that are:  


\- 650x23c in terms of size as that's the limit my bike allows.  
\- Rim brakes as disc brakes cannot be fitted with the fork on this bike.  
\- Something durable and good for hill climbing.  
\- Budget wise I'd prefer something cheaper though I'm open to spending a bit more. I just spend a lot of my time pushing myself on hills, smooth roads mostly and enjoying scenery.  


Someone I know is selling ZIPP carbon wheels for what appears to be a good price, 3 of them (as it's a fellow handcyclist). However these have a deeper rim (58mm) and although they have a brake track, would they last long with the rim brakes? (even if they were made for carbon wheels).

bicycling,"Hi everyone,

I have a question about bike geometry , specifically stack:reach ratio, and how it relates to speed and performance. I'm in my late 40s, 5' 11"", 165 lb, have been biking for a number of years (hybrids, mostly in urban environments). I recently switched bikes, mostly because of a transcontinental move (I didn't want to ship my old bike). The bike I ended up buying was the new Giant Escape 2. I rode a 2014 Marin Fairfax in the preceding years. Yes, I was fitted, and yes, I test rode different bikes in the same class and with comparable specifications before buying the one that felt best for me. The decision to buy the bike was driven by budget, post-pandemic availability, general 'feel', and my comfort level with the shop/staff I bought it from.

I find I'm significantly (about 2.0-2.5 mph) slower on my current bike than I was on my old Marin on rides exceeding 10 miles. I'm currently averaging 13-14 mph on the Giant, while I averaged 15-16 mph on the Marin. The differences between my old Marin and my new Giant are that the Giant has a S:R ratio of 1.4, compared to 1.48 for the Marin. The Giant rides on Giant S-X2 700x38"" tires, while the Marin had Schwalbe Spicer 700x32 tires. I have hydraulic discs on my Giant, had rim calipers on my Marin. These are the key differences. However, I've been riding the Giant at sea level in 90^(o)F and higher temperatures, with high humidity, whereas much of my earlier riding was at 1600-2000 feet above sea level in 60-85^(o)F temps and low humidity. So my question is: Why am I riding slower on the Giant than on the Marin, even though the Giant has a more 'aggressive' geometry? Based on geometry alone, the Giant should be faster (comparable Shimano crankset/cassette too). Is it down to the tires? The weather conditions? Anything else?

At the time I bought the Giant Escape, I was also interested in the Giant Fastroad SL3. The Fastroad is Giant's fastest hybrid (basically a road bike with a flat bar). I didn't buy this bike because it was about $200 more expensive than the Escape 2, unavailable in stock locally, and I would have to wait a long time if I ordered one.

I have a question about bike geometry , specifically stack:reach ratio, and how it relates to speed and performance. I'm in my late 40s, 5' 11"", 165 lb, have been biking for a number of years (hybrids, mostly in urban environments). I recently switched bikes, mostly because of a transcontinental move (I didn't want to ship my old bike). The bike I ended up buying was the new Giant Escape 2. I rode a 2014 Marin Fairfax in the preceding years. Yes, I was fitted, and yes, I test rode different bikes in the same class and with comparable specifications before buying the one that felt best for me. The decision to buy the bike was driven by budget, post-pandemic availability, general 'feel', and my comfort level with the shop/staff I bought it from.

I find I'm significantly (about 2.0-2.5 mph) slower on my current bike than I was on my old Marin on rides exceeding 10 miles. I'm currently averaging 13-14 mph on the Giant, while I averaged 15-16 mph on the Marin. The differences between my old Marin and my new Giant are that the Giant has a S:R ratio of 1.4, compared to 1.48 for the Marin. The Giant rides on Giant S-X2 700x38"" tires, while the Marin had Schwalbe Spicer 700x32 tires. I have hydraulic discs on my Giant, had rim calipers on my Marin. These are the key differences. However, I've been riding the Giant at sea level in 90^(o)F and higher temperatures, with high humidity, whereas much of my earlier riding was at 1600-2000 feet above sea level in 60-85^(o)F temps and low humidity. So my question is: Why am I riding slower on the Giant than on the Marin, even though the Giant has a more 'aggressive' geometry? Based on geometry alone, the Giant should be faster (comparable Shimano crankset/cassette too). Is it down to the tires? The weather conditions? Anything else?

At the time I bought the Giant Escape, I was also interested in the Giant Fastroad SL3. The Fastroad is Giant's fastest hybrid (basically a road bike with a flat bar). I didn't buy this bike because it was about $200 more expensive than the Escape 2, unavailable in stock locally, and I would have to wait a long time if I ordered one. Strangely, the FastRoad SL3 has a less aggressive geometry than the Escape (S:R ratio of 1.48), but a faster crankset and cassette and 32 mm tubeless tires. If this bike is appreciably faster than the Giant Escape, is it because of the gears and wheels? Does geometry play a far less significant role?

bicycling,"TLDR: I bought a CX bike on Kijiji in Toronto and the fork top cap have a PinHead locking screw, which can only be undone using a unique key tool. This made me suspicious.

During the buy, I checked the serial number on project591, bikeindex, and the Canadian police site. All came up negative. When I asked the guy why he is selling, he answered that he have several bikes and this one is just sitting in storage. He claims to be a collector and do seems somewhat knowledgable about bikes. I paid using e-transfer (mobile bank transfer), so I have his email and legal full name. (ofc its possible that he is using someone else's bank account &amp; name). 

After sending the money he tried to login to his mobile banking app but he forgot the password and after 20 minutes of trying he couldn't figure out how to reset the password. At last I just sent a screenshot of my transaction history and he let me go. So far so good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, today when trying to adjust the bike I found that the fork top cap have a pinhead locking screw. But the seat have normal hex screw and both wheels are quick release. This made me really suspicious. I went back to the bike registration websites and looked for Giant 2011 white bikes and still couldn't find any matches. When googling his phone number, I found some other of his posts and it looks like he have sold at least 3 other bikes before.

&amp;#x200B;

Suspicious stuff:

* on the Kijiji listing he misidentified the all AL bike as having ""carbon fork"".
* all of this listings shows location A. During my first attempt to schedule a meet up he gave me the address of location A, but i cancelled it due to schedule issues. The second day I call him again and he gave me an apartment address 5km from location A, which is where i actually met him.
* price is pretty good for Toronto (400$ for a fair condition 2011 MSRP1240$ cross bike) but not unreasonable. Lots of 3-6yo Giant escape and big brand hybrids sells for 400\~600CAD.  
* **the fork top cap is a pinhead lock screw. Seller never mentioned it and I only discovered it after a day.**
* *\[might be completely wrong just my stereotype\]* the seller doesn't fit a ""cyclist"" image. He is a middle age male that was smoking when bring the bike to me, and have somewhat shaky hands and trouble pronounciating clearly (weed problem is pretty common in canada).

What do you all think?

1. Do you think this bike is stolen?
2. Should I contact the police?

if the bike is really stolen im 100% down giving it back. However im not sure how the police will handle it if the bike's status is unclear. I don't want the police just to take the bike for ""possibly stolen"" and auctioning it after a year or so.

bicycling,"I'm having trouble deciding what type of bike I should get next as my ""one &amp; only"" bike.

**Background:**  
I am 42 yrs old in OK shape and apart from having a BMX as a kid, my only recent experience was splurging on a Yeti SB5c which I was too scared to ever take on any trails. Sadly, it only saw the pavement where my friends would leave me behind. And then I only used it whilst my son was learning to ride. Then I sold it.

My son is now 10 and the rest of the family (wife and younger daughter) are keen to go out for family rides: 60% dedicated paved bike tracks / 40% light mountain trails. I am also considering trails without the family (more on that below).

**Don'ts:**  
I definitely don't ever see myself doing any of the following:

* Steep downhill and enduro
* Jumps, obstacles or anything too technical
* Road riding amongst traffic and alongside parked cars 

**Do's:**  
In addition to the aforementioned pavement riding with the family, I only expect to really hit green and some blue trails. Realistically, this will be at a casual pace and with no interest in flatout top speed runs.

**Thoughts/recommendations:**  
I've been told a gravel bike would be perfect as it would cover the pavement riding as well as the green/blue trails.

If I were to consider MTBs again, the green/blue trails and the aforementioned ""don'ts"" would mean only a trail MTB (130-140mm) would be needed - but then I would be wasting it with the pavement riding.

Additionally, I've also considered E-MTBs so that I'm not left behind when riding with my friends (to give me that extra turbo/push), and also to possibly push me into going out and tackling more blue+ trails... However, I never took my Yeti on trails so this could still be just me dreaming again.

Please help! I'm so confused! TIA

bicycling,"I used to ride a lot recreationally in a low traffic rural area, but gave it up years ago after an injury. Now I'm starting again with an ebike as my training wheels, and it's been great! I live in a city now (Portland, OR) and would like to use the bike rather than public transit to get around town as much as possible, but I'm intimidated by urban traffic. 

Due to a lifelong health condition that isn't otherwise relevant here, I've never had a driver's license. I've read the driver's manual and I \*think\* I understand what's happening on the road when others are driving, but I lack the sort of fluency regular drivers have when reading traffic situations, especially at complex intersections. Portland has a lot of bike lanes, but the ones near me are frequently covered in auto glass and debris, and I've read that it's often safer to take the lane with the rest of the traffic so drivers can't ignore me. Whether I'm in the bike lane or not, I get a bit paranoid whenever I have to make a left turn or pass a slower cyclist, among other things.

I'm curious what protips/advice y'all might have for me from the perspectives of both cyclist and driver regarding how best to read and navigate traffic, and also how to avoid creating problems for others by being timid on the road as I'm starting out. Please explain like I'm five; much of the relevant advice I've found online uses a lot of driving analogies, but since I don't drive, that's not super helpful. 

A few questions I'm specifically interested in:   
\-What unsafe habits do you most often see from other urban cyclists? (So I can avoid developing bad habits from watching others)

\-What do drivers and other cyclists most need from me in order to share the road safely, especially at intersections or when passing? What should I understand about a driver's perspective that might not be intuitive for someone who doesn't drive?

\-Bike lanes: when (not) to use them? 

\-If anyone is familiar with the Portland area, where might be a good area to practice getting used to traffic? Know any nice paved trails away from car traffic where ebikes are allowed for some recreational riding? Any other resources I should check out?

I recently got back my old bike (Specialized Allez) from my parents, which had been sitting in a damp, dark, dusty basement for about 5 years. I've spent about 2 days trying to get the front derailleur (Shimano Sora Triple) unstuck - I took it off the bike, gave it a thorough scrub, and have been using various lube/catalysts and working it by hand to get it unstuck, but at this point I think I'm ready to throw in the towel... This thing is done - it still doesn't return to its correct resting position without force even without a cable attached, and my shifters don't apply enough force to move it up the chainring.

What information do I need to find a replacement? I can't seem to find this exact type of derailleur online, so what specs are important? I know that:

- my front chainring is a triple
- my back cassette has 9 gears
- I need a bottom pull
- I need a clamp attachment

bicycling,"# Intro

In recently buying a single-speed cruiser with only coaster brakes (AKA ""pedal brakes"" / ""back-pedalling brakes"" / ""foot brakes""), I had a hard time finding substantive answers to my questions about coaster brakes.

How do they work? Why are they often used for cruisers and kids' bikes? Are they safe?

This is my attempt to answer these questions, please let me know if there are any errors or omissions.

# Myths

Lots of information I found just repeated these claims:

* ""Coaster brakes have low stopping power""
   * Coaster brakes are in fact notorious for easily skidding the back tire, evidence that the immediately stopping power is more than sufficient
   * Drum brakes and rear brakes in general have their own cons related to stopping, see below
* ""Coaster brakes are just on/off""
   * Coaster brakes engage gradually as backpedalling pressure is applied, as long as you control your force, you won't go straight from off to on
* ""People (or kids) shouldn't learn to bike with coaster brakes""
   * Coaster brakes are fine for many uses, including learning, so shouldn't be automatically excluded from consideration

# Facts

Everything about coaster brakes can be examined from 3 views, and these views overlap with other braking systems:

* Drivetrain brake
   * Coaster brakes work by backpedaling -- reverse action on the drivetrain causes the rear hub to engage an internal drum brake
   * Contrary to the name, the brake does not engage when coasting -- if you stop pedaling with coaster brakes, the bike just coasts
   * Due to this dual use of the drivetrain, there are some similarities with a fixed gear drivetrain
* Drum brake
   * Drum brakes are self-contained, using brake shoes to slow the spinning of the wheel at the hub
   * It is also possible to have drum brakes that are operated through hand levers
* Rear brake
   * The brake engaged by backpedaling is only on the rear hub and only applies braking force to the rear wheel

# Pros

* Drivetrain brake
   * No handlebar or cabling clutter
   * Intuitive to have pedals control both ""go"" and ""stop""
   * Hand strength and dexterity are irrelevant
* Drum brake
   * Protected from elements
   * Low maintenance
* Rear brake
   * Useful on rough or bumpy terrain when front braking is hazardous
   * No risk of over-the-handlebars crash when stopping

# Cons

* Drivetrain brake
   * Complexity in the rear hub adds weight
   * Feet need to be on pedals to start stopping
   * Cannot adjust pedal position freely by backpedalling
   * Incompatible with external back gears
* Drum brake
   * Quick to overheat (and cause excessive wear) when used for continous braking (will depend on speed, total weight, and incline)
   * When overheated, will ""fade"" and lose braking power
   * May be difficult to find replacement brake shoes or other parts
   * Can easily cause skidding if over-applied, leading to loss of control and tire wear
* Rear brake
   * When on good terrain, always less effective at stopping vs. a front brake (due to the physics of bike braking)

# Safety

The bottom line for safety is that you should have two braking systems in case one fails, and any rear brake risks being insufficient for emergency or downhill stopping.

So any bike with just a coaster brake should be upgraded to add a front brake (unless your speed and weight are low enough to justify the risks of failure/insufficiency).

Also, to eliminate the risk of an over-the-handlebars stopping crash when using the front brake, be sure to practice emergency front brake stops.

# Conclusion

If you don't need access to many gears (e.g. racing, steep hills) and don't need to backpedal or take your feet off the pedals (e.g. clipless pedals, mountain bike trails), then I think a coaster brake is a reasonable, weatherproof, low-maintenance option for a rear brake.

In recently buying a single-speed cruiser with only coaster brakes (AKA ""pedal brakes"" / ""back-pedalling brakes"" / ""foot brakes""), I had a hard time finding substantive answers to my questions about coaster brakes.

How do they work? Why are they often used for cruisers and kids' bikes? Are they safe?

This is my attempt to answer these questions, please let me know if there are any errors or omissions.

# Myths

Lots of information I found just repeated these claims:

* ""Coaster brakes have low stopping power""
   * Coaster brakes are in fact notorious for easily skidding the back tire, evidence that the immediately stopping power is more than sufficient
   * Drum brakes and rear brakes in general have their own cons related to stopping, see below
* ""Coaster brakes are just on/off""
   * Coaster brakes engage gradually as backpedalling pressure is applied, as long as you control your force, you won't go straight from off to on
* ""People (or kids) shouldn't learn to bike with coaster brakes""
   * Coaster brakes are fine for many uses, including learning, so shouldn't be automatically excluded from consideration

bicycling,"Hello beautiful bicyclists,

I have been riding the same mtb on the same hilly and flat route for a little over a year now, and recently I have found that it requires constant pedalling on flat parts upon which I used to be able to build momentum and coast.

It is quite subtle, but after being bitten by a pack of wild dogs I have outrun for a year, I'm pretty positive that it's not all in my head.

Occasionally I feel that I can hear the subtlest sound coming from the back wheel.

When I lift the bike and spin the back wheel or run the pedals, I can detect nothing.

I have brought it to the best and worst (read only) mechanic in my area and he thinks I'm crazy.  He oiled the break mechanism, replaced the pedals, did something with the front wheel and said it should be fine, but I am experiencing the same issue.

It is most evident on flat road as I need to constantly pedal to keep any momentum and if I attempt to coast I stop much more quickly than I am used to.

While going downhill at speed, I hear no sound, feel no pulling, and am able to spin the pedals on the highest gear with little to no resistance.

Any thoughts or advice is very welcome.

Thank you for your time.","Resistance on MTB, cannot find cause","Hello beautiful bicyclists,

I know they are very strong and can handle  higher loads, so if I want to use it perhaps attach a trailer with a lot of weight in the back for grocery shopping, then I'm not worried at as much about the frame.

bicycling,"I bought a BTWIN road bike 4 years ago and the quality seems either to be bad or I use it incorrectly. It was a \~400€ bike back then, the second cheapest they had in store (Decathlon) and I bought it that cheap because I never owned a road bike and wanted to experience it for once, to see if it is something I would enjoy. And I did enjoy.

Now that the bike needs a repair again, which will be costly (axle bearing and chain wheel), I decided to upgrade instead because my warranty has expired. 

Now I am looking at bikes with a budget off around 1500 Euro and I have 3 in mind. I decided Cube might be a good budget brand, at least that is what I heard and read.

I have a Cube store which I visited yesterday and now have three bikes in mind but I cannot say whether the higher cost bike is a proper investment or not.

The three bikes are:  
 [Cube Attain SL red´n´white](https://www.cube.eu/en/2022/bikes/road/road-race/attain/cube-attain-sl-rednwhite/)   
 [Cube Axial WS Race sparklelilac´n´black](https://www.cube.eu/2022/bikes/women/road-race/axial-ws/cube-axial-ws-race-sparklelilacnblack/)   
 [Cube Axial WS Pro oldmint´n´galactic](https://www.cube.eu/2022/bikes/women/road-race/axial-ws/cube-axial-ws-pro-oldmintngalactic/) 

I am completely unexperienced and now nothing about the parts used in either of these. 

The purpose for the bike is to get from A to B in as little time as possible. I will be using it almost daily to get to university, which is a 20 to 30 minute ride depending on conditions. I would like to use the bike for longer trips also, roughly 50 to 100 km. I don't plan on participating in races or joining a team or whatever. I'd like to use mudguards because I'd like my backpack/trousers to stay dry. I don't mind the loss of aerodynamics. I don't need top times when using the bike so I am with the bike getting heavier for example. I have a lock that is quite heavy and I'll be mounting it in the inside of the frame.

Question now: What exactly are the parts? Do they differ that much? Why is one bike 600€ more expensive? Would I notice that? I was told hydraulic vs mechanic brakes, which is fine. But that cannot be the only difference right? Is the 1600€ bike a little overkill for a commute-bike?  
I'd like it to be sturdy and not break down because the parts have a bad quality. Would I even notice the difference, the different brakes aside. 

Or is there a bike that would suit me better and has a better Value for Cost?

On Sunday 5 March 1939, commencing ""at 2:30pm sharp"" the Gosford-Terrigal Train-Bike-Hike took place.

This event involved a train up from Sydney to Gosford Rail which left Central at 7:40am, and then a bike race with various levels of competition, finishing up out on The Skillion.  Non-locals were able to come up by a special train (see the photos) and return the same way for 6/- return fare.

It got international attention.  It's covered in at least half a dozen papers from Sydney to the Hunter Valley and beyond, and even it attracted three cycling champions from Europe, Gino Bambagiotti (Italy), Charles Rampelberg (France), and Edmond Antoine (Belgium), all members of The Touring Club of France who wanted to participate in ""un jour avec les touristes Australiens"" [a day among the tourists of Australia].  

So keen they were to compete that unlike the plans for the usual Sydney competitors, they skipped the train back to Sydney and arranged for car transport so they could compete that night at an event in Sydney.

Three or four riders from the Kurri Kurri Cycling Club came down on the Saturday and pitched tents overnight near Gosford.

Victorian cycling champion Valda Unthank also changed her plans to come up and take part in the race, arriving in Sydney a fortnight before she'd scheduled her trip to compete in events in Sydney.

As we can see from these fantastic photos from Sydney news photographer R. Wolfe the event was a massive success.  Also we get some great images of Terrigal from March 1939.  Oh how much more rural it was!

Victorian cycling champion Valda Unthank also changed her plans to come up and take part in the race, arriving in Sydney a fortnight before she'd scheduled her trip to compete in events in Sydney.

As we can see from these fantastic photos from Sydney news photographer R. Wolfe the event was a massive success.  Also we get some great images of Terrigal from March 1939.  Oh how much more rural it was!

bicycling,"I ride a mountain bike, although mostly on gravel or pavement at the moment. I don’t have clipless pedals; just the standard flat ones that came with the bike. I’m curious if there’s an advantage to buying cycling-specific shoes or if regular sneakers are good enough. I’m starting to do longer rides and I want to make sure I feel my best both in the saddle and after the ride. 

I don’t have any plans at the moment to switch out the pedals, so I know the differences are pretty much just the reinforced, stiffer sole and “stickier” tread on the bottom, at least as far as cycling shoes for flat pedals go. 

I don’t mind dropping a little money on a pair of decent shoes as long as I can justify why I should. So far, I’ve just been using what are essentially running shoes, as they’re lightweight and well-ventilated.","Cycling shoes?

bicycling,"I recently got “buzzed” by a bus at a high rate of speed. I’d estimate maybe 2 feet at a speed of at least 40mph, but possibly even higher. So much for being a “professional driver.” A friend of mine is a school bus driver (but I’m sure the same applies to all kinds of buses) and he said that, if it were to ever happen again in the future, I should note the time and exact location, plus the number if possible, because they’re easy to track. He mentioned that, at least by his supervisors, unsafe driving near vulnerable road users is taken extremely seriously. In his training, they were taught to pass at a safe distance and speed as if the cyclist were to either swerve or fall off their bicycle. Their recommendation was that, at 3 feet, go no more than 25 mph tops to be able to stop quickly if needed and any speeds over that should be with at least a 5 foot passing distance. His trainer told them that, even if they are found not at fault, they’d still be terminated for hitting a vulnerable road user if the accident was preventable (e.g. if a cyclist fell in their path but the driver was going too fast or passing too close to have time to react).

That got me thinking. What do you feel is more important, passing distance or speed? In an ideal world, a driver would pass at both a safe distance and a safe speed, but we know that’s not always the case. For me, it depends. On slower roads of 25/30 mph, it’s passing distance because a 3 foot distance would be easily enough time to a driver to react in an emergency as long as they’re alert. On high speed roads of 45+ mph, it’s speed that’s more important for me due to the decreased reaction time and because, with this one exception from above, drivers never pass me at those speeds unless they’re able to give a very wide passing distance of 6+ feet. Even then, they’ll still generally slow down somewhat.

bicycling,"I have been sharing the road for a million years, and always get out of the way ASAP. This is the first time I ever went on the record to complain about a driver.  The text of an email I sent to the (unnamed for now) Driving School follows. 

Good morning - I am sending this note in view of an unfortunate encounter I had with one of your instructors this morning. Normally, I would let this pass, but I am concerned it resulted in an unpleasant experience for the student. The instructor is at fault, and the student did not receive proper instruction. I would like to clear the air so you can provide the student with the correct information.  
At about 10:30 Am on Friday in Belmar, I was riding a bike on ocean ave along a string of parked Cars. I noticed a car mirror coming up, about 18 inches from my elbow. I did not know the car was a student driver, but I was concerned they had not seen me. I did what I always do in these circumstances: I made myself known by shouting ""Yo.""  
The car continued passing at a close distance. By this point, I saw the logo for your driving school. The passenger - who I believe was the instructor - was shouting at me to ""share the road."" I was riding in a very narrow space with no where to move, so  shouted back ""4 feet. That is the law!"" In response, the passenger made an obscene gesture and continued to pass.   
I have included the link to the NJ save passing law. Under the law, cyclists and drivers are required to share the road. One requirement is for drivers to pass only when they have 4 feet to spare.  In today's example, I had nowhere to move. The driver also could not provide 4 feet of room, as there was oncoming traffic. I often encounter this situation as a driver and cyclist, especially during the summer. In today's case, the correct procedure was for your car to wait until I could get out of the way, or there was no oncoming traffic.   
If the instructor had taught the law correctly, he would have been able to pass in 50 yards down the road, when the road opened up again. It would have been a great learning opportunity. The delay would have been under a minute.  
I suggest you review the law with your instructor, and inform the student of the error the instructor made and the correct law.

bicycling,"Ive been mountain biking for a long time with flat pedals, and about a year ago I picked up road biking. At first I was using flat pedals, but a month ago I decided to switch to clipless. My first ride was pretty good, I had a little pain so I tried adjusting my cleats, and it seemed to help. I also raised my seat quite a bit when I switched pedals. 

After that first ride I went out and did a pretty hard climb, and near the top I felt some pretty bad pain in my knee. I brushed it off, but when I got home it was still hurting. The pain was mostly on the inside of my knee, but sometimes it would shift to being on top of or below the kneecap. The pain had mostly faded by two weeks, so I went for a recovery mtb ride on flat pedals, but that seemed to make it hurt more.

A week and a half after that and my knee is still hurting, especially on the inside. I have been trying to stretch, ice it,  and do exercises but nothing seems to be working. What should I do to heal my knee?

bicycling,"Howdy,

I ride roads 95% of the time and occasionally I hit gravel.  I'm picking up quite a few flats lately and my tires have looked worn for a while so it's probably time to replace them.  My rims are tubeless capable, but I feel like dealing with sealant, valves, etc. is a real pain in the ass whenever I have to strip the tires off of my 29+ bike (29x3"" tires) with 50mm wide rims.

Is running tubeless on a road bike worth it?  Is it cleaner?  I actually prefer 75 lbs psi because it \*feels\* faster.  Will I still be able to run that kind of pressure?  Is it a hassle to deal with if I have to put a tube in to get through a long ride out in the country?

bicycling,"I had a heated debate with another member in my coop about wide upright saddles vs standard narrow ones. It started because he chose a duct tape covered upright saddle in a pretty bad state over a standard narrow saddle in good condition in the same bin and I asked him why. We went back &amp; forth and finally agreed to disagree as neither of us are a qualified bike fitters but with strong opinions against each other's... 

TLDR (?) ; Is an upright position (and saddle) an alternative to just setting a reasonably good fit ?

He basically argued that those narrow hard foam saddles with their long nose are not ergonomic at all and just marketed and sold to people to feel like Tour de France riders that ride in unnatural and uncomfortable aero positions. We never sit like that in our regular lives and that is why he and many others feel discomfort when using them. They just look good but are impractical for everyday use, are way too thin and unpadded to support you leading to painful pressure points, they should be shunned or banned. On the other hand, the wide, short (nose-less are bee's knees) and properly padded saddles offer the best support for our hipbones when riding in the superior upright position.

My answer was if a person feels discomfort on a saddle its most likely a problem with the fit and/or posture (at least for young healthy people like us with no hip restrictions) rather than the saddle itself. Cycling is a very complex biomechanical chain of contact points and adjustments and it's very easy to blame the saddle for crotch pain when it could just be a bit of angle adjusting or reducing reach. I took my time to try to get a comfortable position on my drop bar bike and I can ride it for hours on a BLB Raven saddle and so can many others when carefully setting it up. (He does not believe me...)

The ""need"" for upright position is an over compensation for bad experiences with ""normal"" positions and we all have surely seen some terrible setups : from dangerous extended vertical stem angles (or just facing backwards), slammed saddles or the famous bum bars in search of that ""comfortable"" upright position that then, ironically, puts more pressure on your rear because the weight is not distributed with your upper body leading to excessively wider and more heavily padded saddles with springs and so on... 

Sorry for the rant, I would like to hear your takes on this :)",What do you think about upright saddles / posture ?,"I had a heated debate with another member in my coop about wide upright saddles vs standard narrow ones.

bicycling,"#Basis:

A modern steel bike is heavier in frame design and delivers worse overall ride qualities.

#Anecdote:

This affects mid and even upper-tier bikes (if not top-end) steel bikes. Most frames manufactured with ""4130"" seem to be very overbuilt in terms of material amount.

**Upper End:**

Bianchi Pista (steel), a $1000 bike that has butted chromoly frame tubes and PG chromoly stays, so a fully chromoly bike. It has no eyelets, no cable stops, no downtube shift bosses, under-bottom-bracket cable guides, no derailleur hanger. The Pista 1 had a threaded headset. The Pista 1 seems to weigh around 20 lbs. (The Pista 2 has a threadless and cable stops/brakes, too, mind you, but we're using the Pista 1 for our weight specs here).

For comparison a 1980s/early 90s Schwinn Tempo made of Columbus Tenax (re-badged Cromor) is lugged. It has all those things- butted main tubes, PG chromoly stays, plus brake levers, brake calipers, brake hoods, pads, cables, housings, shifters, downtube shift bosses, bottom bracket cable guides, 2x. derailleurs, ratcheting cassette with extra cogs, an extra chainring, thicker crank/chainring bolts, and extra chain length. (Trying to get everything here). But at the end of the day, the Schwinn weighs...21 lbs. Taking those things off, even with the eyelets, bosses, and cable stops left on.

The Tempo was in no way the top-end of the Schwinn steel lineup, with 105 componentry- the circuit, peloton, and paramount/prologue were all higher-end steel (straight-up Columbus SL or SLX, instead of ""Tenax SL"").

**So, what happened? Why is it that converting a mid-end bike from the 1980s-1990s compares favorably in a fixie configuration is lighter than a bike from 30-40 years later, where no compromises were supposedly made in making it as light as possible in its design?** (Sure there're lighter track and fixie bikes with limited runs and other materials, but we're comparing 'steel to steel,' here, and 'mass produced to mass produced.')

**Mid End**

#My theory on the root cause:

Metallurgy is complex. But we have to ask: *what is the premise and purpose of using 4130*?* That it's improved over normal steel in strength, durability, and longevity. The main selling point is that it's allowing the manufacturer to use less material in the frame, thereby creating a lighter weight frame that's not any weaker than if you made it of normal steel with more material. 

In-house makers (e.g. Reynolds, TrueTemper, Tange, Columbus, Vitus, etc.,) claim theirs is superior, but 4130 is supposed to be the generic version. ""Same active ingredients, therefore basically as good as.""

Let's examine that claim.

Presumably, you can design your bike to take advantage of 4130's properties (less material, equal strength). However that's assuming that the tubing coming from the factory *is* 4130, (*or* that 4130 is the same as Reynolds, Vitus, etc.,, but let's let that lie for now). 

**Here's where supply chain obscurity/opacity creates an issue for designers, an unenviable choice:**

Do they design like it's 4130 they're working with, with thin tube walls creating a lightweight bike? Or do they overbuild *just in case* the material isn't as strong as it's supposed to be? (Bad batch at the factory with poor QA, factory deliberately using cheaper material and pocketing the difference, as is so often the case in certain countries with limited oversight?) Especially if you're a small maker.

Well, what happens when you design it like it's 4130? You get what happened to QBP/All-City. A ""chromoly"" bike fell apart on the rider, brand new.

Most designers, therefore, seem to be building like it's Hi-Tensile, ""normal"" steel they're working with, offsetting almost any benefit you're getting. Therefore...what incentive do the more unscrupulous factories have to build with anything *but* Hi-Tensile and market it as 4130? Is what you're riding 4130? Are you going to run a metallurgical report on it?

Interestingly, Reynolds continues to manufacture lighter and lighter bike frames- and they can likely vouch for their own processes.

Stems and other parts meant to fit bikes of yesteryear are also heavier- anywhere from 30-50% depending on the stem, (barring something from Velo Orange, Paul, or so on that happens to fit).

I think it's interesting to see some magazines dunk on vintage bikes and vintage designs- without really understanding what we've lost or that modern componentry/frames with a vintage material and design aren't the same as what they once were. 

This isn't to say we haven't made advancements technologically- especially STI (though adding weight it's a clear upgrade) or to dunk on all modern bikes- but it does call into question whether we're getting what we're paying for.",Controversial take: Steel bicycles from anywhere but the very top-end are largely worse than their heyday of the 1970s-1990s,"#Basis:

A modern steel bike is heavier in frame design and delivers worse overall ride qualities.

#Anecdote:

This affects mid and even upper-tier bikes (if not top-end) steel bikes. Most frames manufactured with ""4130"" seem to be very overbuilt in terms of material amount.

**Upper End:**

Bianchi Pista (steel), a $1000 bike that has butted chromoly frame tubes and PG chromoly stays, so a fully chromoly bike. It has no eyelets, no cable stops, no downtube shift bosses, under-bottom-bracket cable guides, no derailleur hanger. The Pista 1 had a threaded headset. The Pista 1 seems to weigh around 20 lbs. (The Pista 2 has a threadless and cable stops/brakes, too, mind you, but we're using the Pista 1 for our weight specs here).

For comparison a 1980s/early 90s Schwinn Tempo made of Columbus Tenax (re-badged Cromor) is lugged. It has all those things- butted main tubes, PG chromoly stays, plus brake levers, brake calipers, brake hoods, pads, cables, housings, shifters, downtube shift bosses, bottom bracket cable guides, 2x. derailleurs, ratcheting cassette with extra cogs, an extra chainring, thicker crank/chainring bolts, and extra chain length. (Trying to get everything here). But at the end of the day, the Schwinn weighs...21 lbs. Taking those things off, even with the eyelets, bosses, and cable stops left on.

The Tempo was in no way the top-end of the Schwinn steel lineup, with 105 componentry- the circuit, peloton, and paramount/prologue were all higher-end steel (straight-up Columbus SL or SLX, instead of ""Tenax SL"").

**So, what happened? Why is it that converting a mid-end bike from the 1980s-1990s compares favorably in a fixie configuration is lighter than a bike from 30-40 years later, where no compromises were supposedly made in making it as light as possible in its design?** (Sure there're lighter track and fixie bikes with limited runs and other materials, but we're comparing 'steel to steel,' here, and 'mass produced to mass produced.')

**Mid End**

#My theory on the root cause:

Metallurgy is complex. But we have to ask: *what is the premise and purpose of using 4130*?* That it's improved over normal steel in strength, durability, and longevity. The main selling point is that it's allowing the manufacturer to use less material in the frame, thereby creating a lighter weight frame that's not any weaker than if you made it of normal steel with more material. 

In-house makers (e.g. Reynolds, TrueTemper, Tange, Columbus, Vitus, etc.,) claim theirs is superior, but 4130 is supposed to be the generic version. ""Same active ingredients, therefore basically as good as.""

Let's examine that claim.

Presumably, you can design your bike to take advantage of 4130's properties (less material, equal strength). However that's assuming that the tubing coming from the factory *is* 4130, (*or* that 4130 is the same as Reynolds, Vitus, etc.,, but let's let that lie for now). 

**Here's where supply chain obscurity/opacity creates an issue for designers, an unenviable choice:**

Do they design like it's 4130 they're working with, with thin tube walls creating a lightweight bike? Or do they overbuild *just in case* the material isn't as strong as it's supposed to be? (Bad batch at the factory with poor QA, factory deliberately using cheaper material and pocketing the difference, as is so often the case in certain countries with limited oversight?) Especially if you're a small maker.

Well, what happens when you design it like it's 4130? You get what happened to QBP/All-City. A ""chromoly"" bike fell apart on the rider, brand new.

bicycling,"Greetings! Quick question. Last week, I brought my bike in (hybrid bicycle if that makes any difference) because it needs a new spoke. The bike shop informed me that it would be approximately one week to fix it, but hopefully sooner. I did follow-up to check on the status and it should be ready tomorrow, which would make it one week. 

Is this typical? I read online that spokes take approximately 30 minutes to repair. I had other work done a few weeks ago when they informed me of the spoke, but said that it would be safe to ride for a while and that I could make an appointment, which I did. However, I certainly wasn’t expecting it to take a week, especially when making an appointment to bring it in. If it only takes 30 minutes, I’ll ask tomorrow why I couldn’t have just brought it in when the time came for the repair (which I thought I was doing). I’ve been thinking of taking it to a different repair shop in the future, but am curious as to whether or not this is normal. It’s not the first time I’ve had to leave it for an extended period of time.

bicycling,"Hello people, I'm new here.  
In the past 3-4 years I've tried to implement exercises in my routine to solve some mental health problems I have, mainly anger issues, little paranoia and low self-esteem.  


As I don't have much knowledge about exercising, but like to read a lot, I did some research and found that spending 1 hour of walking everyday could help me overcoming my bad thoughts and anger problems, but this solution was not helping much.   
So I thought that the exercising solution was no the right one and that finding therapy was the answer.  
I was even beginning to feel unmotivated towards life thinking ""God, why It's so difficult to change my mind, will I have to do therapy forever? Will it really be so f\*\*king difficult to get better?"".  


But then I remembered that lots of people wrote here on reddit that going to the gym and getting very tired made them feel great mentally, so I had the idea to find some exercise more strenuous than walking (but not lifting weighs as I don't like it and already do some bodyweight exercises) in a last attempt to find a solution., and cycling came to my mind.  


I got my old bicycle with no gear and started to cycle it through my neighborhood, and let me tell you something: I know there's not a silver bullet for anything, but in my first day of cycling, as I was reaching the 25 minute mark, my bad thoughts LITERALLY LOST MUCH OF THEIR STRENGHT. Bad thoughts that I could not stop thinking about  before started to get their volume lower in my head. It really felt like magic, I was amazed.  


So my daily routine now is cycling 50 minutes and I'm feeling great. I really never felt like this before. Even when I'm very tired I leave my home and try do It and I never regretted it. Thank God I live in a place that I'm able to do it even at night.  


And to resume all this thread:  I discovered that the pace of the exercising is something of immense value for your mental health. You should not do an exercise that you won't even sweat, even if It's for 1 hour, because a light exercise won't help you so much with bad thoughts. You have to find something you like and do it at least in a moderate level, not a light level. You have to sweat and suffer a little.  


And a tip for you: doing some sprints for some seconds while you are cycling  is a cool tip because It aids in your sweating, read about HIIT and try to implement it in your cycling routine.

bicycling,"I am a newer cyclist. Only picked it up during the pandemic. I had a back injury that had me out of the game for about 4 months and I had slowly built back up to about 40 miles a week.

Saturday, I was on my first 30 miler and at mile 19, I was on a bike path following my friend. He took a little dirt off shoot and I followed. There was a big rock I swerved to avoid and I overcorrected. Subsequently winding up riding straight into a downed tree branch, flipping over the handlebars and dislocating my shoulder.

EMS came to get me and the PA on board said not to knock it back in in the field. So off to the hospital I went.

I can say that was the most pain I have ever experienced in my whole life. Hands down. I am waiting to go to the Ortho tomorrow to see what's next for me. Maybe an MRI, maybe surgery. I've had surgery on my other shoulder so I at least know what I can expect from it. AND holy crap it could have been way worse. I am so thankful that it wasn't. The soreness from the accident is setting into the rest of my body but I'm honestly not feeling too bad at all.

That said, I guess I am posting this because I am a little scared of my bike now. I panicked. I forgot everything. I learned lessons and all that but I am definitely afraid to ride again at the moment.

bicycling,"Hi friends, I have been contemplating buying one of the above two bikes. This would be my entry into road biking and I’m gearing towards Endurance due to its focus towards comfort then pure speed. I have easy access to hills that I want to enjoy but my current bike (bulls sharptail 3) which I bought without much knowledge doesn’t help me and is very difficult with climbing which is why I’m thinking to get an Endurance road bike.

Now I’m confused between the above two. Both are very similarly spec’s. Canyon would be available sometime around September but as you may all know, there’s no way to experience it as it would be an online buy. On the other hand, trek is available at a nearby store right now. I’m leaning towards Canyon mainly due to color option but it is also around two pounds lighter than trek. The points in favor of Trek is of course it’s available locally and it’s a bigger brand and probably a life time warranty whereas on Canyon it is six years.

My first impression was that the chain is rubbing on the gears beside the one it’s in, but there is a little bit of side to side movement of the chain when stationary so it’s not that. 
I bought two cassettes (one for the trainer and one for the wheel), so I swapped them over and the noise is the same.

I hope you are well! I posted a post a few days earlier looking to choose between a kona sutra and a koga world traveller for my touring expositions.

Unfortunately as I am in South Korea, getting one of these shipped here is waaaaay to expensive. As a result I have started focusing on what I can buy here in the interim.

I have found a Kona Libre 2021 (specs posted below). My current sizing for a Kona libre Bicycle is a 54cm frame but the ones I can get hold of are only available in a 52cm Frame. My measurements are as follows

Height. 178cm Leg inseam 82cm Torso. 62cm Arm 58.5 cm

I am wondering could i make this work? What adjustments would i have to make to make this bicycle more suitable and comfortable for me? More spacers to raise the headset, move the saddle back and maybe a longer handlebar stem?

bicycling,"Hello everyone!   


I'll try and keep the story short. Wife's car engine blew. We are down to 1 car now. Which, is fine because I work from home. But, it's kind of frustrating not being able to run to the store if I need to pick something up for dinner or maybe want to go to the park or some stores that are nearby.   


I am certain that I do not want a car. We really do not need 2 cars, nor do we want the financial responsibilities of 2 cars. So, I think a bike would be a great option. It is as eco friendly as it gets, and it's great for health!   


Uses for the bike, the quick trip to the grocery store to pick up a few things. I'm talking some canned goods, a bottle (or box) of wine, and smaller things. Not whole chickens or big boxes of soda or anything like that. Going to the occasional store like Goodwill, clothing store, Best Buy, etc etc.   


Everything is within an 8 miles radius. As far as my area in Tennessee being bike friendly, it's... maybe 50/50?

Thanks for reading and any help you all will provide!",Down to 1 car. Really considering getting a bike - advice needed,"Hello everyone!   


I'll try and keep the story short. Wife's car engine blew. We are down to 1 car now. Which, is fine because I work from home. But, it's kind of frustrating not being able to run to the store if I need to pick something up for dinner or maybe want to go to the park or some stores that are nearby.   


I am certain that I do not want a car. We really do not need 2 cars, nor do we want the financial responsibilities of 2 cars. So, I think a bike would be a great option. It is as eco friendly as it gets, and it's great for health!   


Uses for the bike, the quick trip to the grocery store to pick up a few things. I'm talking some canned goods, a bottle (or box) of wine, and smaller things. Not whole chickens or big boxes of soda or anything like that. Going to the occasional store like Goodwill, clothing store, Best Buy, etc etc.   


Everything is within an 8 miles radius. As far as my area in Tennessee being bike friendly, it's... maybe 50/50?

bicycling,"Does anyone remember this 1980s  recumbent trike  and the name of it and the manufacturer?
I test rode  this   trike sometime in the mid  1980s, and I wish I remembered the name.

  Here's the frame geometry.  It's in two major halves. the rear half: two wheels are joined by an axle about a meter wide. Horizontally forward from the axle is a triangle, roughly equilateral. Rising vertically from the axle is another triangle.  At the apex of each triangle is a headset bearing at 45 degrees, these bearings are concentric.

the second half of the frame is the cockpit. It's oval, with a headset bearing at each end, top and bottom. Your body is supported by a hammock. By your feet is the drive wheel. You steer by grabbing bars which are fixed to the rear frame and flopping the cockpit left or right. Flop left, go left, vice versa. 



Two headset bearings/tubes to join the cockpit to the rear frame. One headset is behind your head and the other is below your knees.  that joint is raked about 45 degrees. When it flops to one side, the wheel will be at a 45 degree angle, even though the rear axle prevents you from leaning. That gives your turning force.
 


When you turn to one side, there's some kind of force that wants to toss the steered front wheel in the opposite direction. It can oscillate in a self-potentiating increasingly violent flopping left and right until it throws you out of the trike to one side - broken wrist /shoulder etc. hazard if you allow the wobbling to get out of hand.  So you would need some kind of damper on the steering. Terrible for climbing because the drive wheel is so far from the cg but on level ground it's  a serious blast.",Does anyone remember this 1980s recumbent trike and the name of it and the manufacturer?,"Does anyone remember this 1980s  recumbent trike  and the name of it and the manufacturer?

bicycling,"The helmet shown has a length-to-width ratio of 1.23. What are yours?

*Processing img 77fwytupc1d91...*

Asian bikers know that helmets sold in America are generally not shaped properly for their heads. This is a nuisance that only Asian people appreciate. Even with so-called Asian-fit helmets, I still have to order one size up, and ratchet down. This has bothered me so much that I took time to research online, and to measure my own helmets for an honest account of the current state of misery.

Most helmet sold in the US have a length-to-width ratio of 1.3, measuring only the inner bowl of the EPS foam. Some Asian-fit helmets are a bit rounder, at 1.24. But none come close to the average 1.16 ratio of an Asian head.

I measured three helmets I own. These are helmets I tried and bought at brick and mortar stores. They fit me well, but only after I ratchet down significantly on the adjustment strap. Here they are. Thousand Heritage, size Medium, length=8 5/8″, width=7″, ratio=1.232. Giant Talos, size LG/XL, length=9 1/8″, width=7 1/4″, ratio=1.258. Bauer Re-akt, size Large, length 8 1/4″, width 6 3/8″, ratio 1.294.

If this issue bothers you as well, would you take some time to measure your helmets and post your measures here? I'll add a table to collect these measures for everyone's benefit. Let's measure them the same way, for consistency. See how I measure them here on this page. Let's collect: brand model, size, accommodated circumference range as indicated by sizing chart (or printed label on the inside bowl), measured length, and measured width. Use any units you choose. I can convert them.

bicycling,"Hi All:

I'm a relatively new road biker. I originally had a Tubular wheelset on the used road bike I purchased and after using it a while, I realized that it's expensive when it comes to flats. (have to replace the whole tire if it's not repairable with the Stans No Tubes)

The tubulars were 700x25c. 

The Tubulars had a dreamy ride quality to them. 

I just got myself a pair of used clincher wheels and they came with Vittoria Rubino Pro tires off Craigslist for a good price. These are a Ultegra WH6700 and I dont believe they are tubeless.

The new tires are 700x23c

When inflated to about 90 PSI as indicated on the tire, I am able to ride them, but the ride is super bumpy. I really feel  the road...  I tried lowering the PSI and it gets harder to pedal.

My request:

Can you all recommend a good pair of tires for me?  There are sometimes some glass pieces and goatheads around the area that I bike, so I want something that is stronger puncture-resistant and still gives me a good ride as flats arent fun.

is it good to go back to 25c?  I am NOT a racing person. Just trying to ride  to get fit. I average 4-10Miles a day (depends on day) and it is mostly a paved road in a city bike lane.

I will be answering questions and comments, especially for the people who are planning something like a hard climb and want more specific advice.  There is no TL;DR.

In June of 2021 I climbed Spruce Knob in West Virginia at an FTP of 265 watts and had a blast.  The beginning 10% grades were challenging with 34-28 gearing, but the 2nd half was a breeze.  When I got back from the trip, I wanted more.  Everything else in that area wasn't significantly higher than that, so I decided to go for Mt Mitchell in September and by then my FTP was around 280.  I completed Mt Mitchell from the Marion side, so total elevation gained was 6,234 ft (1900m).  This ride was still much easier than expected, and there's nothing higher east of the Mississippi.  I had overprepared with a small backpack, allen wrenches, 4 clif bars and a normal windbreaker.

I began googling and found the website pjammcycling.  It's a great tool to search for climbs, and I just decided to go straight for Pikes Peak.  
[https://pjammcycling.com/climb/11.Pikes-Peak](https://pjammcycling.com/climb/11.Pikes-Peak)  
Looking at the altitude profile, this road is nasty.  It only gets steeper as you climb higher.  The ride is 24 miles (38km) which is only 4 miles (6.5km) shorter than Mt Mitchell, but it's 8,007 ft (2,440m) of elevation gain, 1,773 ft (540m) more.  The kicker to this, is that the climb starts in Manitou Springs, which is roughly 6,000 ft (1,828m) above sea level.  The Pikes Peak Summit has an altitude of 14,115ft (4,302m)

 **Training**:  
I live in a flat city, 800ft (243m) above sea level.  The closest climb to my house is a hill with about 100ft (30m) of elevation.  Fortunately, in 2019 I bought a Tacx Flux S trainer and I've been using it all the time year round.  If you want to get stronger on the bike and maintain your fitness throughout winter, I cannot recommend a smart trainer enough.  It changes everything, and it's the best tool to use for big challenges like this.  I also have TrainerRoad, which has been amazing because I can make custom workouts on their desktop app.  I had hit a plateau at 280 watts because I love sweet spot training, which is 85%-95% of FTP.  (Note:  FTP stands for Functional Threshold Power, which is basically a ""Max Power Hour.""  Those of you that do work on the trainer, hopefully this jargon makes sense.  If you only ride outside without power, this probably won't make a lot of sense) My favorite training ride is just a 12 minute warmup that gradually comes up to 85% FTP, and then I hold that for 48 minutes and end with a 5 minute cooldown.  I started integrating threshold work in November, usually doing 2x20 minute sets at 98% FTP, and then later I discovered that 3x10 minute sets at 102% FTP worked wonders.  Every time I could complete 4x10 minute sets at 102% FTP, I knew it was time to bump the FTP up.  My attention span lasts about 90 minutes on the trainer, but sometimes I would do endurance rides that last two hours.  I'd say 70% of my rides are an hour, 20% are 90 minutes, and 10% are two hours.  As the weather warmed up in May and June I started doing endurance rides outside on the weekends.  I would just try and have an average power of above 200 watts, and if I was feeling good I'd try and keep it above 215 watts.  My weekly average time on a bicycle and trainer is around 8 hours.  I hate doing FTP tests because I put a lot of pressure on myself, they're super painful, and I usually feel like I'd benefit more from just a solid workout instead of almost blowing up for 20 minutes at 105% FTP.  I don't do the ramp tests on TrainerRoad because those don't feel accurate.  I've had issues where ramp tests will actually recommend a lower FTP than what I had previously performed, but in actuality my legs have been training for long sweet spot efforts and couldn't handle the huge lactic acid buildup of a ramp test.  That being said, I prefer to just go by feel.  
I eat decently clean with a plant based diet, but in March I gave up chocolate and most alcohol to lose 5lbs over 3 months.  I would still drink one beer at most per week as a reward for getting through tough rides on the trainer.  I also started incorporating big salads as an appetizer almost every day when I'd cook dinner after a workout.  I don't have much of a social life so my sleep schedule is dialed in to about 7 hours every night.  Single with no kids, I work 9-5ish so my schedule is consistent.  I do work a physically demanding job that has me walking all day.  Whenever I'd have an unexpected day off, the training would be noticeably easier physically and mentally.  My body responds much better to exercise in the evenings rather than early mornings before work.  
The loose goal was a 3.5 hour ride from the Manitou Springs roundabout with an average power of 200 watts.  I did not bring a backpack this time.  My jersey has three pockets:  my left pocket had my wallet and a new thin windbreaker made for cycling.  The middle pocket had the flat kit and my phone.  The right pocket had 6 goos and 2 small ziplock bags of gatorade for my 24oz bottles.  This is about 1,040 calories.  I also had an extra dinner of two PB&amp;Js before bed and 1,000 calories of oatmeal packets for breakfast.  The big goal was to just make it up safely, preferably without stopping.  
**The Ride**:  
I'll break this section down into four parts: From Manitou Springs to the Toll booth, from the Toll booth to the brake check, brake check to peak, and the descent.  
Parking in Manitou Springs is a nightmare.  I had scouted it out the day before, and I'm glad that I did.  It's not difficult to find that early, but there is no free parking.  I paid $36 for 7 hours, because it gets too much tourism for its size.  I arrived at the roundabout in Manitou Springs at about 6:30am and the weather was a perfect 67 degrees (19C) with pretty much no wind.  The ride up route 24 was good.  Cars were respectful (they're respectful all over Colorado as a whole) although the shoulder does pretty much go away in some parts.  There was very little debris, maybe a piece of glass here and there, but way better than my city.  This part of the climb was easy breezy because the grade is 3-6%.  Nothing special.  When I turned off of 24 and onto Pikes Peak Highway, the grade immediately changed to around 8%.  This is where it gets fun, because you're off of the highway and into the winding road through the national forest.  I arrived at the toll booth around 7:15, and it was closed!  They open at 7:30, so I'll remember this for next time.  I just had to sit tight and wait.  The staff was accepting payment before opening the gates, so right at 7:30 all of the cars that had paid went through and then section two began.  
From the toll booth to the brake check is easily the best part of the ride.  You basically just chug along at a 4-8% grade.  Sometimes it gets steep and punchy, sometimes it's only 3%.  It does flatten out with a small descent about half way through the whole ride, so that was a nice break.  At this point I'm starting to feel the altitude a bit, but my legs still feel fresh, average power is probably around 215 watts, I'm drinking gatorade, eating goos and having a blast.  Crystal Lake Reservoir is almost the halfway point, but I don't even remember seeing a building that should have been the visitor center so I just didn't stop.  There was a lot of construction on the left side where the building should have been.  I still had most of one bottle, but this prompted me to drink more because I was probably behind on hydration.  About two or three miles from the brake check building I ran out of gatorade.  
The brake check station had full amenities.  I chugged half a bottle of just water, mixed new gatorade bottles and threw away empty goo packets.  At this point I have two goos left, my legs still feel good and I'm back on the road in a few minutes.  In my opinion, *This is where the Pikes Peak climb starts*.  Once I was above the tree line, it's just a different climb.  This last section is why threshold training is so important; it built up mental fortitude and kept me focused.  The altitude started getting to me around 11,000 feet (3,352m).  The grade is around 10% pretty much all the time, and some of the inside hairpins are brutally steep.  On any outside turn, the pavement flattens a decent amount and I would drink gatorade every time, like a mini break.  It's possible to drink and pedal in a straight line, but you'll have to catch up on breathing quite a bit.  I only had two gusts of wind and the cars were still being really respectful.  There is a very small descent of maybe a quarter mile around mile 21.  This got me very excited because it's basically free mileage to the top; less distance to the finish.  Don't be fooled like me.  The last 2 miles are brutal.  I was starting to get tired, but the altitude changed everything.  It basically feels 50% harder.  I was putting down about 200\~210 watts, but it felt like 280-300.  A few hairpins below the top, I could see the visitor center overlook.  This was an amazing piece of motivation, because it created the anticipation of reaching the top.  
The top is amazing.  The views are amazing.  The sense of personal accomplishment is so fulfilling.  The food is stupidly expensive.  I reluctantly paid $5 for a small pack of spicy mixed nuts.  I'll let the pictures do the talking here.  It's a huge tourist attraction, and a lot of people asked if I rode my bike all the way up the mountain.  One of my favorite jokes to make when someone asks me a dumb question with an obvious answer, is to say: ""No, I biked all the way up the mountain.""  They'll usually understand that I'm being a dick and get the joke, or they'll be very confused.  It's great!  My moving time was 3 hours 23 minutes with an adjusted power of 205 watts.  
The descent is unbelievably fun.  From peak to brake check, it's kind of nerve wracking.  They've repaired some pieces of the road and it doesn't have a perfect transition.  It got a little bumpy, but my rim brakes did just fine because I had cleaned the brake track before the trip.  It actually wasn't cold, I felt very comfortable.  Granted it was around 56 degrees (13C) at the peak, but my hands were fine and the windbreaker did well.  A thicker windbreaker and gloves is probably a good choice in a month that isn't July.  I think I truly got one of the best days of the year to do this because it was pretty hot every day in Colorado Springs.  Once I got below the tree line, from brake check to toll booth, it's basically the dream descent.  I even had a car move over for me!  There was a point where I was stuck behind two cars, but they were going so slow that it was easy to pass them on a long straight.  From the toll booth back down to Manitou Springs on 24 was also a lot of fun.  I was cruising at about 32mph (51kph) and the traffic was busier, but not too bad.

**Final Thoughts and Advice**:  
This was incredible.  It is a hard ride, but I think the internet puts the difficulty on a pedestal.  The only thing that I wish I would have practiced that I didn't anticipate would be pedal technique.  Pedal technique will make the third section more bearable.  I never felt overwhelmed, or wanted to give up.  I did get annoyed a few times by doing a steep straight section, going around the hairpin only to find another steep straight section.  For me, the 34/32 gear combo was perfect.  34/34 would have just slowed me down.  I probably would have survived a 34/30 but it would have been rough.  
My advice for summiting Pikes Peak would be to train as hard as you can for at least four months if your fitness level is low.  Lose extra weight if you have time.  A stationary trainer has so much value.  Riding with power changes everything because you can dial in the perfect workout as well as track progress.  If you don't have access or can't afford these tools, find *THE STEEPEST* hill or mountain near you and ride it over and over.  I wish I had access to a 12% hill because there are tons of ways to train with just one hill.  Do hard intervals on it.  Do pedal technique work on it.  Do 6,000ft (1,828m) of elevation in a day.  Do endurance rides that last at least 2 hours.  
If you don't enjoy climbing, you're missing out on more than just a fun aspect of cycling.  There's an immense amount of personal growth and tons of lessons to learn from doing something like this.  It takes planning, dedication, nutrition (day of and leading up to the event) and a little ambition.  My FTP was pretty good when I decided to do this, but it definitely improved with this goal on the horizon.  It doesn't take money.  If you have a decent bike, that's enough.  You could do this on a triple chainring rim brake if you had to.  You might have to buy a different cassette, but you can make your own goos (which I plan on doing in the future) and gatorade powder is cheap.

If you only ride outside without power, this probably won't make a lot of sense) My favorite training ride is just a 12 minute warmup that gradually comes up to 85% FTP, and then I hold that for 48 minutes and end with a 5 minute cooldown.  I started integrating threshold work in November, usually doing 2x20 minute sets at 98% FTP, and then later I discovered that 3x10 minute sets at 102% FTP worked wonders.  Every time I could complete 4x10 minute sets at 102% FTP, I knew it was time to bump the FTP up.  My attention span lasts about 90 minutes on the trainer, but sometimes I would do endurance rides that last two hours.  I'd say 70% of my rides are an hour, 20% are 90 minutes, and 10% are two hours.  As the weather warmed up in May and June I started doing endurance rides outside on the weekends.  I would just try and have an average power of above 200 watts, and if I was feeling good I'd try and keep it above 215 watts.  My weekly average time on a bicycle and trainer is around 8 hours.  I hate doing FTP tests because I put a lot of pressure on myself, they're super painful, and I usually feel like I'd benefit more from just a solid workout instead of almost blowing up for 20 minutes at 105% FTP.  I don't do the ramp tests on TrainerRoad because those don't feel accurate.  I've had issues where ramp tests will actually recommend a lower FTP than what I had previously performed, but in actuality my legs have been training for long sweet spot efforts and couldn't handle the huge lactic acid buildup of a ramp test.  That being said, I prefer to just go by feel.  
I eat decently clean with a plant based diet, but in March I gave up chocolate and most alcohol to lose 5lbs over 3 months.  I would still drink one beer at most per week as a reward for getting through tough rides on the trainer.  I also started incorporating big salads as an appetizer almost every day when I'd cook dinner after a workout.  I don't have much of a social life so my sleep schedule is dialed in to about 7 hours every night.  Single with no kids, I work 9-5ish so my schedule is consistent.  I do work a physically demanding job that has me walking all day.  Whenever I'd have an unexpected day off, the training would be noticeably easier physically and mentally.  My body responds much better to exercise in the evenings rather than early mornings before work.  
The loose goal was a 3.5 hour ride from the Manitou Springs roundabout with an average power of 200 watts.  I did not bring a backpack this time.  My jersey has three pockets:  my left pocket had my wallet and a new thin windbreaker made for cycling.  The middle pocket had the flat kit and my phone.  The right pocket had 6 goos and 2 small ziplock bags of gatorade for my 24oz bottles.  This is about 1,040 calories.  I also had an extra dinner of two PB&amp;Js before bed and 1,000 calories of oatmeal packets for breakfast.  The big goal was to just make it up safely, preferably without stopping.  
**The Ride**:  
I'll break this section down into four parts: From Manitou Springs to the Toll booth, from the Toll booth to the brake check, brake check to peak, and the descent.  
Parking in Manitou Springs is a nightmare.  I had scouted it out the day before, and I'm glad that I did.  It's not difficult to find that early, but there is no free parking.  I paid $36 for 7 hours, because it gets too much tourism for its size.  I arrived at the roundabout in Manitou Springs at about 6:30am and the weather was a perfect 67 degrees (19C) with pretty much no wind.  The ride up route 24 was good.  Cars were respectful (they're respectful all over Colorado as a whole) although the shoulder does pretty much go away in some parts.  There was very little debris, maybe a piece of glass here and there, but way better than my city.  This part of the climb was easy breezy because the grade is 3-6%.  Nothing special.  When I turned off of 24 and onto Pikes Peak Highway, the grade immediately changed to around 8%.  This is where it gets fun, because you're off of the highway and into the winding road through the national forest.  I arrived at the toll booth around 7:15, and it was closed!  They open at 7:30, so I'll remember this for next time.  I just had to sit tight and wait.  The staff was accepting payment before opening the gates, so right at 7:30 all of the cars that had paid went through and then section two began.  
From the toll booth to the brake check is easily the best part of the ride.  You basically just chug along at a 4-8% grade.  Sometimes it gets steep and punchy, sometimes it's only 3%.  It does flatten out with a small descent about half way through the whole ride, so that was a nice break.  At this point I'm starting to feel the altitude a bit, but my legs still feel fresh, average power is probably around 215 watts, I'm drinking gatorade, eating goos and having a blast.  Crystal Lake Reservoir is almost the halfway point, but I don't even remember seeing a building that should have been the visitor center so I just didn't stop.  There was a lot of construction on the left side where the building should have been.  I still had most of one bottle, but this prompted me to drink more because I was probably behind on hydration.  About two or three miles from the brake check building I ran out of gatorade.  
The brake check station had full amenities.  I chugged half a bottle of just water, mixed new gatorade bottles and threw away empty goo packets.  At this point I have two goos left, my legs still feel good and I'm back on the road in a few minutes.  In my opinion, *This is where the Pikes Peak climb starts*.  Once I was above the tree line, it's just a different climb.  This last section is why threshold training is so important; it built up mental fortitude and kept me focused.  The altitude started getting to me around 11,000 feet (3,352m).  The grade is around 10% pretty much all the time, and some of the inside hairpins are brutally steep.  On any outside turn, the pavement flattens a decent amount and I would drink gatorade every time, like a mini break.  It's possible to drink and pedal in a straight line, but you'll have to catch up on breathing quite a bit.  I only had two gusts of wind and the cars were still being really respectful.  There is a very small descent of maybe a quarter mile around mile 21.  This got me very excited because it's basically free mileage to the top; less distance to the finish.  Don't be fooled like me.  The last 2 miles are brutal.  I was starting to get tired, but the altitude changed everything.  It basically feels 50% harder.  I was putting down about 200\~210 watts, but it felt like 280-300.  A few hairpins below the top, I could see the visitor center overlook.  This was an amazing piece of motivation, because it created the anticipation of reaching the top.  
The top is amazing.  The views are amazing.  The sense of personal accomplishment is so fulfilling.  The food is stupidly expensive.  I reluctantly paid $5 for a small pack of spicy mixed nuts.  I'll let the pictures do the talking here.  It's a huge tourist attraction, and a lot of people asked if I rode my bike all the way up the mountain.  One of my favorite jokes to make when someone asks me a dumb question with an obvious answer, is to say: ""No, I biked all the way up the mountain.""  They'll usually understand that I'm being a dick and get the joke, or they'll be very confused.  It's great!  My moving time was 3 hours 23 minutes with an adjusted power of 205 watts.  
The descent is unbelievably fun.  From peak to brake check, it's kind of nerve wracking.  They've repaired some pieces of the road and it doesn't have a perfect transition.  It got a little bumpy, but my rim brakes did just fine because I had cleaned the brake track before the trip.  It actually wasn't cold, I felt very comfortable.  Granted it was around 56 degrees (13C) at the peak, but my hands were fine and the windbreaker did well.  A thicker windbreaker and gloves is probably a good choice in a month that isn't July.  I think I truly got one of the best days of the year to do this because it was pretty hot every day in Colorado Springs.  Once I got below the tree line, from brake check to toll booth, it's basically the dream descent.  I even had a car move over for me!  There was a point where I was stuck behind two cars, but they were going so slow that it was easy to pass them on a long straight.  From the toll booth back down to Manitou Springs on 24 was also a lot of fun.  I was cruising at about 32mph (51kph) and the traffic was busier, but not too bad.

**Final Thoughts and Advice**:  
This was incredible.  It is a hard ride, but I think the internet puts the difficulty on a pedestal.  The only thing that I wish I would have practiced that I didn't anticipate would be pedal technique.  Pedal technique will make the third section more bearable.  I never felt overwhelmed, or wanted to give up.  I did get annoyed a few times by doing a steep straight section, going around the hairpin only to find another steep straight section.  For me, the 34/32 gear combo was perfect.  34/34 would have just slowed me down.  I probably would have survived a 34/30 but it would have been rough.  
My advice for summiting Pikes Peak would be to train as hard as you can for at least four months if your fitness level is low.  Lose extra weight if you have time.  A stationary trainer has so much value.  Riding with power changes everything because you can dial in the perfect workout as well as track progress.  If you don't have access or can't afford these tools, find *THE STEEPEST* hill or mountain near you and ride it over and over.  I wish I had access to a 12% hill because there are tons of ways to train with just one hill.  Do hard intervals on it.  Do pedal technique work on it.  Do 6,000ft (1,828m) of elevation in a day.  Do endurance rides that last at least 2 hours.  
If you don't enjoy climbing, you're missing out on more than just a fun aspect of cycling.  There's an immense amount of personal growth and tons of lessons to learn from doing something like this.  It takes planning, dedication, nutrition (day of and leading up to the event) and a little ambition.  My FTP was pretty good when I decided to do this, but it definitely improved with this goal on the horizon.  It doesn't take money.  If you have a decent bike, that's enough.  You could do this on a triple chainring rim brake if you had to.  You might have to buy a different cassette, but you can make your own goos (which I plan on doing in the future) and gatorade powder is cheap.

bicycling,"I have a 2022 giant Tcr road bike with carbon steerer

I went to trek because they have fast service that is pretty good from my experience

They cut the the steerer. I personally saw one of the  ""mechanics"" cut the steerer with the fork attached on the bike and the other holding the bike because it was vigorously swaying left and right on the  park tool bike stand. I turned away not looking what I saw.

The guy that cut the steerer hands me the bike and I pay. During this time I believe they didn't even test ride the bike but I don't know. What I know for sure is the SERVICE manager told me that he didn't check it which is what they are supposed to do from my thinking

I rode the bike right after I paid and after 300 meters I realized the the fork was wobbling. Indicating to me that the stem cap wasn't tightened properly.

Went back to trek right away.

The STORE manager took a look. Took the bike to the mechanics area. I saw him lecture the employee that worked on and handed me the bike.

The manager proceeded to re cut the steerer.

This time the fork was dropped out of the frame. The fork was put on a vice. The steerer was cut elligantly.

The STORE manager finished and gave me the bike and apologized. I don't remember specifically what he said but it was not specific to the point like what the SERVICE manager told me.

I rode the bike didn't look it over because I assumed that everything was okay from what I saw.

After around 150 meters of riding. I notice the aero spacers were not inline with the stem. Yes, a small issue but at this point I have had to wait around 2 hours to watch a bunch of monkeys try to cut a straight line on a tube.

I went back.


This time I spoke to the STORE manager. I explained to him the spacer is not straight. Immediately after I said do I have to pay for this (slightly showing some anger in the tone of my voice). He said something along the lines of ""people make mistakes"" At this point I just wanted to leave the shop and didn't conversate as much with my replies. He started loosening the stem and steerer bolts to realign the aero spacer. At that point I said to home I'll do it myself at home. I have a torque wrench. he says, you don't want to your handle bars to be straight? 
I said I'm a picky guy I'll end up redoing everything when I get home (I understand this is not the most elegant way of responding considering he personally cut the fork and apologized to make things right.


Then I said something the lines if ""this might be a special bike"" with the intention of meaning that this is a GIANt bike and not everything is the same as a TREK bike that they work on hence why I probably had to come back twice as this point. He looks at my bike and then said "" your bikes not special, we work on bikes 3 times more expensive than yours here"".

 hahahaAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH

I open my eyes and blink a couple times in disbelief of what he said and immediately reply whispering ""you guys are great here but this is the second time I have had to come back."" He nodded and said let's go get you a refund. I said thank you and left the front doors. Started riding and I am in the back of the store, I heard satine yell at me saying ""hey"" I see that it is the guy the originally cut my steerer. He wanted me to be happy and apologized. He also said they torqued the steerer compression plug at 12nm instead of 4nm which is clearly printed on the plug (WHAT THE FUCK)

I thank him for letting me know, I won't tell your manager you told me that and you shouldn't have told me that.

I leave.

At this point, I am so confused. What do y'all think of this situation? Am I the problem? With the times I have gone to a bike mechanic. I am SOMETIMES unhappy with the level of service. I understand I can be very particular and spend a lot of time tweaking things so they are perfect which is something mechanics aren't inclined to do since I'm not a professional racer and they got the job done.","went to trek to cut a steerer, employee said they torqued the steerer plug at 12 NM instead of the rated 4nm","I have a 2022 giant Tcr road bike with carbon steerer

If the seat post were oval, for example, then there would be no mis-alignment at all. The bike seat still can go up or down, but not veer to the right or left. 

I don't think that manufacturing an oval seat post or an octagonal one is that hard at all. 

Why isn't this adopted more widely?Why are seat-posts circular? They should be anything but circular to guarantee that the seat is aligned."

bicycling,"I ride a hybrid bike (kona dew deluxe with 700cc tires) on a hilly (lowest elevation of 97m and highest of 130m) 10km commute. Some days the hills can be hard but it's challenging and I like the exercise. 

I borrowed a road bike (ghost nivolet race carbon fiber), got it fitted, swapped my pedals over since I didn't have clipless shoes, and spent the whole day commuting and familiarizing myself with it.

Pros:
-I went a lot faster and reached a higher top speed.
-I used less energy doing it. I can feel the efficiency of the pedaling.

Cons:
-Uncomfortable posture. Lower back didnt enjoy the posture even though I spent most of the time holding the tops.
-At times felt wobbly. Like I felt every bump on the road and a few potholes felt like I was gonna wipe out and get my skinny tires stuck in them.

I know the natural progression is to switch to the road bike. But I am not entirely sure I like it more than the hybrid.

bicycling,"**Advantages of Carbon Fiber Frames**

As an emerging material, carbon fiber not only has the inherent characteristics of carbon materials but also has the soft processability of textile fibers.

Its specific gravity is less than 1/4 of steel, but its strength is very strong, and its corrosion resistance is outstanding.  
Nowadays, carbon fiber materials have been widely used in various series of frames, for example, [the well-known brand TRIFOX](https://www.trifoxbike.com/) uses T800 and T1000 carbon fibers.

Generally speaking, carbon fiber as a bicycle material has the following characteristics,

1. Lightweight

Carbon fiber frames are very light due to their density and tensile strength, such as [TRIFOX’s Carbon MTB Frame SDY21](https://www.trifoxbike.com/lightweight-carbon-mtb-hardtail-frame-boost-sdy21) is made of T800 carbon fiber against the direction in which the stress occurs for strength.

2. Good Shock Absorption Performance

Carbon fiber can effectively absorb shock and maintain good rigidity.

Using its excellent shock absorption performance, it is famous to make bicycles without shock absorbers, such as [TRIFOX’s Carbon MTB Frame MFM100](https://www.trifoxbike.com/mfm100-full-suspension-carbon-mtb-frame).

3. Frames of Various Shapes Can be Made

Different from the manufacturing process of general metal frames, this manufacturing process can use aerodynamics to create a frame with the least wind resistance.  
The basic molding method of carbon fiber is to lay the fiber sheet on the mold, and then pour it into the resin for firing.

It can be made into frames of various shapes, such as [all series of frames from TRIFOX](https://www.trifoxbike.com/carbon-bike-frames).

&amp;#x200B;

**Disadvantages of Carbon Fiber Frames**

1. Complex Stress Calculation

The carbon fiber frame is made of carbon fiber, which is characterized by strong tensile strength but weak shear strength.

Complex stress calculations (longitudinal stiffness and lateral stiffness) are required during processing, and carbon fiber sheets are superimposed and formed according to the calculations.

Processing technology varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, and it is important to choose a product from an experienced and reliable manufacturer (TRIFOX).

2. Difficult to Change The Size

It is difficult to change the size due to molding after the mold is completed. Unable to respond to orders of multiple sizes and styles.

3. Aging

Will the resin deteriorates when used?

This is an existing theme, and it will gradually turn white when placed in the sun.

Of course, this phenomenon is related to the manufacturer’s technology.

It is best not to put it in the sun.

4. Expensive

Compared with titanium alloys, carbon fiber frames are more expensive, mainly because the manufacturing process of carbon fiber frames requires lots of labor, and the scrap rate is very high, resulting in a substantial increase in cost.

&amp;#x200B;

**Types of Carbon Fiber Bicycles**

1. Full-carbon

All carbon fiber bicycle accessories are made of carbon fiber materials.

2. Semi-carbon

Many bicycles are made of aluminum alloy + and carbon fiber. For example, a frame may be made of carbon for the top tube and aluminum for other parts (or carbon for the rear triangle…), carbon fiber for the front fork arm, and aluminum for the front fork tube, so it can be said to be semi-carbon.

3. Carbon Wrapping

For some frames, handlebars, stems, cranks, forks, seat posts, and other accessories, the manufacturer uses an aluminum alloy to make it and then wraps a layer of carbon cloth on the surface, which is the carbon wrapping thing.

The relationship between carbon fiber bicycles and the environment

Carbon fiber contains resin so it can also be said to be acid-resistant.

But for carbon fiber, internal factors should be considered more, it uses resin, so the possibility of resin aging exists.

A carbon fiber bike should be kept out of the sun when not in use, with sunlight and ambient temperature having the greatest impact.",Advantages and Disadvantages of Carbon Fiber Bicycles,"**Advantages of Carbon Fiber Frames**

As an emerging material, carbon fiber not only has the inherent characteristics of carbon materials but also has the soft processability of textile fibers.

Its specific gravity is less than 1/4 of steel, but its strength is very strong, and its corrosion resistance is outstanding.  
Nowadays, carbon fiber materials have been widely used in various series of frames, for example, [the well-known brand TRIFOX](https://www.trifoxbike.com/) uses T800 and T1000 carbon fibers.

Generally speaking, carbon fiber as a bicycle material has the following characteristics,

1. Lightweight

Carbon fiber frames are very light due to their density and tensile strength, such as [TRIFOX’s Carbon MTB Frame SDY21](https://www.trifoxbike.com/lightweight-carbon-mtb-hardtail-frame-boost-sdy21) is made of T800 carbon fiber against the direction in which the stress occurs for strength.

2. Good Shock Absorption Performance

Carbon fiber can effectively absorb shock and maintain good rigidity.

Using its excellent shock absorption performance, it is famous to make bicycles without shock absorbers, such as [TRIFOX’s Carbon MTB Frame MFM100](https://www.trifoxbike.com/mfm100-full-suspension-carbon-mtb-frame).

bicycling,"So I bought this bike a couple years ago when I was trying to decide if I wanted to get back into mountain biking (biked when I was a kid), the terrain around here is pretty flat, so I bought an XC bike to start off with. I recently got a new bike, was considering either keeping this one around for friends to use or selling it. I recently (embarrassingly) realized that the wheels on this bike are NOT 29ers (which I should've realized after more than a year of riding it), they're 26"". I loved the bike while I had it, so I'm not upset or anything, but if I do sell it, I don't want to say it's something it's not and now I'm not totally sure what bike I have. I *think* it is just a Giant Anthem X 29er that the guy I bought it off put 26"" wheels on, but I'm not sure. I did try to look up the bike using the serial # on the frame, but can't find where to do a serial # lookup. If anyone else does though, the serial reads F/N : GV0115598.

Always enjoyed riding.  I am truly my happiest on a bike.   Have put thousands of miles on a 2009 Giant FCR, which is basically, a fitness or hybrid bike.  Two years ago I bought a Rize RX (DTC ebike....) and a funny thing has happened...

I've now put thousands of miles on my Rize and still regularly switch between the Giant and the Rize.  Lately, I've been favoring the Giant and my appetite for hard, long rides has been awakened.  Three weeks ago I drove to a very nice LBS that seems to really cater to serious riders.  No attitude, lots of attention, and even test rode a Wilier SL that was pretty impressive.  The fuse was lit, but I found myself interested in a Cervelo Caledonia, which seemed to be in my price wheelhouse, and delivered the carbon frame and Rival etap mech.

Next day, a LBS employee rang me to follow up and confirm that they had a July shipment of bikes and it contained one 56cm Caledonia w/Rival etap.....problem is....it's a Caledonia 5, which is NOT in my wheelhouse.  They said do you want to come in when it's here and built and ride it?  If you do, we'll give you right of first refusal before we offer to anyone else.   I replied.....""I'll take it!""

Three weeks have passed and the LBS called to say the Caledonia 5 has arrived and they will set about building it and will ring me when it's done &amp; ready to ride.

I got bumped on price point, or I bumped myself, still not sure....but I'm crazy excited for my first big-boy road bike.  Furthermore, I'm marveling at how buying an ebike, which draw so much ire and derision from so many, has brought me full circle back to regular bikes.  If it were not for the e-bike, I would not have re-engaged with riding.

bicycling,"I've always got my eyes open for a new bike. Recently saw what looks like a great price on a entry level Gravel Bike for Polygon Bicycles. They have a model Bend 2 and Bend 5. Both appear to be great values with their respective blend of components. Both are the same aluminum frame, with a carbon fork and thru axles. 

I've never heard of Polygon Bicycles. I currently own bikes from Trek, Specialized, Cannondale, Fuji and Airborne. Polygon looks to be a directly to consumer brand, like Motobecane.

Anyone have any experience with a Polygon Bend 2 or Bend 5? Would it be an adequate entry level gravel'r? Any idea of the weight in size med or lrg? 

I currently own a Fuji Tread 1.3 and think it is a nice entry level adventure bike. But I'm not fond of the top-tube cable routing or the quick release wheels. Also, the grearing is just short of 1:1 at 34/32 which I think would be a minimum acceptable low gear for actual gravel riding where I live. Curious if a Bend 2, or Bend 5 would get me to the next incremental level.

bicycling,"Hello, apologies if this type of post is not allowed, but I really need some assistance and advice.

I recently purchased a Poseidon X, which I was super happy with. After my first ride I noticed that the front tire pressure wasn't being maintained (at around 35-40 psi) so I re-pumped it back up. On my third ride I experienced a pretty sudden loss of tire pressure and my front tire became flat. I was cycling on a mix of 75% smooth tarmac and 25% loose dirt/mud along a popular and frequently used cycle/jogging path.

After taking off the tire and checking in a bucket of water I found three small slits along the 'seams' of the inner tube (basically the join marks from what I assume is from the rubber injection process). To me, this looks sort of like fatigued or perished rubber, as they appear more like horizontal cracks or slits rather than pierce punctures. I'm worried that even if I repair these cracks more will appear as I use my bike, and I am anxious to avoid being stranded.

[See pictures and videos here](https://imgur.com/a/LUJIfCN)

Having done some reading, I've come across two main types of puncture: either from a sharp object (nail/glass etc.), or a 'pinch' puncture caused by an inner tube that is not adequately inflated whilst traversing harsh terrain. Neither explains my issue as it seems strange that I would have 2/3 punctures in my tire on only my third ride in very modest conditions for a gravel bike. 

The problem is, Poseidon is refusing to help unless its classified as a manufacturing defect on the wheel. Is it possible that the inner tube was faulty and the rubber fatigued/perished? Surely its unlikely that I punctured my tire simultaneously in multiple places at the exact same moment. 

What should I do? Thanks so much.",[Help] Is my inner tube faulty? New bike has 2-3 punctures along the inner tube seams after only a couple of rides.,"Hello, apologies if this type of post is not allowed, but I really need some assistance and advice.

I was cycling on a mix of 75% smooth tarmac and 25% loose dirt/mud along a popular and frequently used cycle/jogging path.

After taking off the tire and checking in a bucket of water I found three small slits along the 'seams' of the inner tube (basically the join marks from what I assume is from the rubber injection process). To me, this looks sort of like fatigued or perished rubber, as they appear more like horizontal cracks or slits rather than pierce punctures. I'm worried that even if I repair these cracks more will appear as I use my bike, and I am anxious to avoid being stranded.

[See pictures and videos here](https://imgur.com/a/LUJIfCN)

Having done some reading, I've come across two main types of puncture: either from a sharp object (nail/glass etc.), or a 'pinch' puncture caused by an inner tube that is not adequately inflated whilst traversing harsh terrain. Neither explains my issue as it seems strange that I would have 2/3 punctures in my tire on only my third ride in very modest conditions for a gravel bike. 

The problem is, Poseidon is refusing to help unless its classified as a manufacturing defect on the wheel. Is it possible that the inner tube was faulty and the rubber fatigued/perished? Surely its unlikely that I punctured my tire simultaneously in multiple places at the exact same moment. 

What should I do? Thanks so much.[Help] Is my inner tube faulty? New bike has 2-3 punctures along the inner tube seams after only a couple of rides."

I'd say the most important aspects to me are fit and durability. If I'm spending a good chunk of money on a bike, I'd like it to last a good while. No one has these in store in my size locally, so I can't really go in and try them out. The guy at REI said the Ghost runs a little big compared to others, and looking at the specs compared to Trek's XXL, that seems to be true. I'm gravitating towards the Trek though more out of brand recognition, and because it has that super attractive red paint option. I've never heard of Ghost Bikes before, and don't know much about their quality. Trek on the other hand is a brand that has been around for a long time, and there's a Trek shop just a few miles from me. I like the look of all the specs on the FX 2 and it seems to be a well regarded bike, I think one of my main questions is the 18 speeds of the FX vs the 27 of the Ghost. If I'm just riding for exercise/casual commute, will that really make much of a difference? The only other big difference is hard tail vs rigid, will I care about having front shocks? I don't plan on doing any MTB trails.

I know some of the big old brand names…like Pinarello, Bianchi, Puegot, Da Rosa, Felt…I’m targeting anywhere from 50-300.

Any tips on how to start/go at looking? Appreciate any help!!!Any tips to buying old/vintage steel bikes?"

bicycling,"I've never built a bike from the ground up before - at best I've just swapped out a few parts to meet a specific goal.

I've been eying a Surly Straggler for a while, since it seems like a decent do-it-all bike at heart, is steel which I'd like to try out in a frame, and ~~I'd like to join a cult~~ Surly seems like a fun enough brand if I ever decide that matters to me.

Plus the snail's kinda cute.

Unfortunately the only Surly shops remotely close to me are claiming issues getting fully built bikes in my size (46cm?) but have offered to build them up from a bare frame to whatever spec I suggest.  But I don't really have a clue what I'm doing there.

Stock it seems to fit my desires with the exception of not having a native reduction gear - something I'd like because I'm a pathetic climber.  Other than that I think I would have to go tubeless - there doesn't seem to be a good all-terrain type tyre similar to the Knard's it comes stock with that's also as puncture resistant as the Schwalbe's I've become accustomed to, and that's something I want.

It looks like both of these can be solved easy - SRAM Apex comes in a 40t that would give me at least a slightly lower ratio, and the rims are Tubeless ready (though apparently the stock tyres are *not*).

But it seems like a waste of a potential opportunity to walk away with something better without a whole lot extra spent, so now I'm trying to figure out what to even look at.

I'm not married to any specific part per se but I do like these general features:

* 1x drive train (that's still trendy, right?) - not strictly married to it but I like the idea.
* Non-electric drive train
* Relatively low geared (1:1 minimum); I'd rarely use anything lower but I do have some tours in mind where it may be useful to have.
* Wide-ish tyres that can still fit fenders (puncture resistance being king).  Starting to get into some lighter off-roading - my Mondials have served me thus far.
* 650b because I'm short (5'3ish"", 30"" inseam in shoes)
* Flared drop bars (because they look cool - I seem to find hood/flat riding positions more comfortable than straight bars for whatever reason, but I'm never fast enough for drops to matter).  Maybe those Moloko bars?
* Disc brakes (mechanical is fine; they've served me so far on my current commuter and the ones the Straggler comes with stock are apparently even better than my Tektro Aries)

I figure maybe a budget of 1.5k - 2k USD?  I'm not sure I'm in a position to set something firm.

As for details, I'm not really on the up-and-up on what's good and what's not - especially for things like rims, hubs, stems, bottom brackets, seatposts.  Let alone if there's a better 1x11(ish) drive train I should hone in on.  I know hydraulic discs are better, but for the degree of cycling I'm capable of I don't know that it's more useful to me specifically.  I'm 50/50 on dyno-hubs - like the concept, but I don't know that I actually need them since I always carry two sets of Cygolights and can't remember a single time I ran either of them dry.  Things like racks and fenders I can sort out easily enough (saddles and pedals always being personal), but the guts of the machine I'm not certain on how to pick.

bicycling,"I'm relatively new to cycling.  For the past two years, I have been enjoying doing 15-25mi road/gravel/trail rides on my \[very\] old GT Ricochet MTB.  As my rides are mostly on paved road and gravel, the MTB isn't ideal.  I'm averaging 11-13mph on these rides over the past year or so.

After doing a bit of research, I \*think\* I'm most interested in a gravel bike.  Gravel bikes seem to offer many of the advantages of a traditional road bike, but can support larger and wider tires for going off the pavement.  I believe I can also just buy a spare set of wheels+tires for pure road rides if desired.

I'm still a novice who doesn't even really have any ""real"" cycling gear (clothes, etc) and I'm not looking to spend a fortune on my first road/gravel bike.  I figure that I can always trade the bike in in a year or two if I want to upgrade.  

With that being said, my local shop has a couple [KHS Grit 220s](https://khsbicycles.com/bikes/2022-khs-models/grit-220-2022/) in stock that I have my eye on.  At first, I wanted to go with Trek Checkpoint ALR or one of their other gravel bikes, but they are obviously more expensive and harder (impossible?) to find in stock.  Any thoughts on the Grit 220 as a ""starter"" bike?  What should I be looking for in terms of features/etc in a bike like this?  Are there any immediate upgrades that would be worthwhile?

So first things first: I know everyone's butts are different, so I am not asking for a general recommendation.

Does the cushion settle in and get uncomfortable after a long ride, as with regular cushioned saddles? What are your experiences?

So being able to go up hills isn’t really a big deal and most of my riding is on side roads and not busy traffic. Is there a gear ratio I can do that would provide a higher/more comfortable top cruising speed?  To maintain a high crushing speed I feel like I have to pedal 2x as much as the old bike and am wasting a lot of energy.

Then I picked up a Kona 29er recently to start riding the single track in my town. I’m in the Midwest and our trails are pretty tame, so I think the front suspension fork could disappear and I would be fine. 

Here’s my thought: if I were to consolidate into one bike to work for both of those uses, what would people recommend? The place I’m at right now is getting a gravel style bike and then picking up a separate wheel set with road tires for the occasional time I wanna go speedy.

You’ll never know what you meant to me, and the cycling world may never know how great you were, but I am compelled to commit to writing what an unsung hero I knew you to be. Sobbing as I eulogize the snippet of your grace I was blessed to immortalize. 

You were a college town (Carbondale IL) bike expert. You knew everything. Every generation’s size, compatibility and overlaps. A true guru, the likes of which only Sheldon Brown could claim. With your ugly big fish and Birds you would shuffle through boxes of derailers and chainrings to find the replacement component we needed. You kept us kids moving to class and back. You fixed our bikes on shoestring budgets with expert craftsmanship. Even other start-up shops in town would bring you their more difficult work, because, you were simply the best. 

Near my senior year, you showed me a 1985 Club Fuji. You explained it was owned by a local homeless man, as the man had aged, the frame was too large for him, and so, Joe, in your infinite compassion, you traded that homeless man a properly sized bike to keep him comfortably mobile. Recognizing the geometry of the frame was a good fit for my body, you sold it to me for $90. Knowing everything, the bike was a perfect fit, and I’ve never felt the need to upgrade. 


Despite having not seen you for nearly a decade Joe,  I can not describe my devastation learning from your sudden passing. Today, I will attempt to ride that bicycle up Lookout Mountain, a goal of mine since I moved to Denver. 
Tomorrow’s ride, all my rides,  my entire passion for cycling, I dedicate to you Joe. The greatest cycling hero I could ever know. Success or failure on the morrow, every summit I ever concur, is thanks to you Joe.

bicycling,"I'm working into the market for another bike (eying the Surly Straggler but I'm open to similar bikes) and I'm trying to figure out what size I'd need.  I think I'll eventually get a proper bike fitting when my schedule allows (no local shops for it), but in the mean time I'm trying to orient myself better.  The measurements I've got of myself are:

Height (without shoes) 63.5"" (161.29cm)

Arm span 64"" (162.56cm) 

Ape Index +0.5"" (+12.7cm)

Inside Leg (with riding shoes using the book-between-legs method) 30"" (76.2cm)

&amp;#x200B;

So going by my height and looking at Surly's [chart](https://surlybikes.com/uploads/downloads/15924_SUR_Bike_Sizing_Chart_OL_VF.pdf) I'm in the 5'0-5'5"" range and should start looking at 38cm to 46cm bikes.  I'm around the middle to upper end of that range so I'd assume 42cm and 46cm to be more likely than 38s, but apparently one should have 2"" / 5cm of difference between one's inseam and the bike's standover height (which for me is 762mm - 50 mm = 712mm, which is actually less than the 42cm frame offers).  

Additionally, I've heard that if you have a positive ""Ape Index"" - which I do, slightly - the advice is to err on the larger side of things (I guess for Reach / effective top tube reasons).  So would that be the 42cm?  I actually have no idea how to convert ""body measurement to stack and reach"".  I'm actually not even sure why stack is relevant (reach I get though).

For reference I currently ride a 19"" (48.26cm) Montague Navigator that seems to only have the issue of slightly too long of a stem.  I've also ridden a 19"" Trek 1200 from the early 90s that had something like 29"" of standover on it (which did feel a bit intrusive when I straddled it at lights).

So what would you all advise?

bicycling,"Hello, everyone. I'll cut straight to the point: I bought a Garmin 530 a year and a half ago or so and, for the most part, I'm happy with it. That is, until I need to plan a route on the go.

1.I can't upload a new route from my phone while it's recording. This is frustrating, to say the least, as I then have to merge my separate rides into one. This aspect was not mentioned anywhere. One thing to note: my watch (not Garmin) allows route uploading while recording.

2.The 530 has no search feature on the map. You can only browse the map, try to find what you're looking for and set that point as the destination. This can take up to 10 minutes or more. Now, this one's on me, as I sort of figured that the lack of a proper input method won't help when searching for an address.

3. The phone app sucks equally, as it doesn't have a search feature, either. I usually end up creating a route in another app, then exporting as gpx to the Garmin Connect app and sending it to the device

While we're on the topic of complaints: 

4.The elevation profile feature is useless. The user manual doesn't really tell you how it works or what it's supposed to mean, but from what I can tell, I think it shows the elevation profile of the part of the route that's currently shown on the screen.

5. The app doesn't show you where you currently are on a course, either. This would at least allow you to see the remaining elevation profile.

So, do other brands such as Wahoo or Hammerhead have such specific issues or did they get them right?

3. The phone app sucks equally, as it doesn't have a search feature, either. I usually end up creating a route in another app, then exporting as gpx to the Garmin Connect app and sending it to the device

While we're on the topic of complaints: 

4.The elevation profile feature is useless. The user manual doesn't really tell you how it works or what it's supposed to mean, but from what I can tell, I think it shows the elevation profile of the part of the route that's currently shown on the screen.

5. The app doesn't show you where you currently are on a course, either. This would at least allow you to see the remaining elevation profile.

So, do other brands such as Wahoo or Hammerhead have such specific issues or did they get them right?

bicycling," Hi! A couple of months ago I had a problem with a part of my bicycle, specifically that the bottom bracket got stuck due to a seized and oxidized thread. It was a nightmare of several weeks going with different mechanics and never having success, it went to the point that I had to spend a third of my weekly budget to buy tools to try myself, and after two complete days of work, the only thing that worked after an entire can of penetrating oil was to heat the cage of the bottom bracket 30 minutes straight and then using a 17"" breaker bar. When it came to guessing who or what to blame, I got to the conclusion that the fault was mine; weeks before the incident I washed my bike and I used too much degreaser when cleaning my chainrings, letting it access the bottom bracket area and chew the grease on the thread, the thing that mixed with the occasional rains of my city created a monstrous layer of oxide. So, since that happened, I'm aware of how much my bike gets in the rain and how problematic can be to clean it in the wrong way, and also I've trying to use the best grease that I can find (currently Lucas Red 'n Tacky).

 It leads me to the present. I have been riding in several heavy days of rain during the last two months due to the hurricane season (maybe nothing extreme but something to be aware in my opinion), and I have been washing my bike every month with room temperature water and dish soap , but the other day I realized how exposed was the zone of the headset to the elements and how easy is for water to get inside, so it worries me. But the actual thing that makes me worry (sorry for making you read too much text) was that after its routine wash, the handlebar seemed to resist moving a bit in the first movement of the handlebar, as it was a bit stuck and with some force, it got normal again. It wasn't really hard to move, it was just too """"tight"""" to do it freely. After that, it has been completely normal, and I can turn with no problems. Any advice, opinions, or suggestions?",May my bicycle cleaning schedule or methods be damaging my bike?," Hi!

bicycling,"I need new tires for my 2018 Electra Townie 21D, with Electra fenders. The fender specs say 2"" max tire width.  Riding is almost all road and paved trails, with occasional gravel trails.  Current tires are stock 26x2.

After a bit of research, I'm liking the Schwalbe Big Ben's. Problem is that the minimum width in 26"" is 2.15 so I'm concerned about fit with the fenders. Hoping somebody else has tried going with tires slightly wider than 2"" with the same fenders and can provide feedback about whether it worked, with or without minor modifications.

If the Big Ben's are a no go, I'm considering Big Apple or Marathon Plus, which are both available in 26x2.0.  The Big Apples have a lot of rave reviews about ride quality and lots of people swear by the puncture resistance of Marathon Plus.  How different is the ride between the two?

* Bought a front basket for my bike recently.
* My bike doesn't currently have a bracket for the head tube, not did the  basket include one. So I went to my local bike shop to get it installed.
* At  the shop, I was told I could not attach it from the head tube because  of my brake cables (said basket would push them in too much), so I'd have to use a quick release bracket instead.  The quick release bracket didn't seem to provide the sturdiness I wanted  so I left the store.

* Brake cables are cables!! Is it so bad if they're being pushed closer to the  head tube by the basket...? Part of me thinks the dude just didn't wanna  do the work because it's not profitable for him or something... 🤔
* They do seem to stick out more than necessary atm...can I have them shortened and install the basket?

Are there small time/cottage makers of bike bags? Specifically panniers?Small business bag makers?"

bicycling,"Hi

I'm trying to help a friend.  He has an old, over 50 years, old bike. The problem as he described it is that the chain is slack. According to the LBS it's due to a bad spring in the back chain steerer (don't know the English name). They offered to replace all the gears but that feels wrong. Where can one get a new spring? Or help? Situated in the south of Sweden so either local help there or online.

Much obliged!",Help with gears,"Hi

bicycling,"I am looking to build a bike and have a question on selecting the frame. I already have one great bike and am doing this as a learning experience. I would like it to have a hybrid commuter aluminum frame and to build the bike around a 1x10 drivetrain using the microSHIFT Advent X 10 speed shifter, derailleur and microSHIFT Advent 11/48T or Sunrace 11/51T Cassette. 

When selecting the frame, am I to make sure that the frame itself is an appropriate size for a 10 speed? Or is this accounted for when selecting the rear hub/wheel? Or both in some way?

I am looking at several Marin aluminum frames, such as the Fairfax, Kentfield, San Rafael lines etc. They are typically sold with a rear 7 or 8 speed cassette. There is one example of the Kentfield 2 2023 that uses the same drivetrain and I think it may be the same aluminum frame as their 8 speeds which makes me think this is doable to use the same frames for 10 speeds. So can I use them to build a 10 speed? 

If those frames aren't appropriate, then any suggestions on a hybrid commuter aluminum frame for a 1 x 10 would be appreciated. The more laid back the geometry the better.

It had some issues before I put it into storage two years ago, and now that I’ve gotten it out of storage again I’m noticing it has more issues than I remembered. The chain rubs and makes noise when it’s on the largest gear in the front, the front suspension fork will dip down and brush the top of the front tire when I stop, and there’s something weird in how it responds to handlebar movements that makes me wobble/weave at low speeds (but it’s fine once I get going faster).

I’m taking it to a bike shop soon to get it checked out, but I want to make sure my expectations are realistic. I’m pretty fond of this bike, it’s the most comfortable frame and size I’ve ever had, but I’m also aware it’s 15 years old and had an MSRP of $370 when it was new, so it probably wasn’t built to last forever.

I am OK with putting a few hundred into fixing/replacing whatever is wrong with it if after that I’ll have a solid reliable bike (I really like this bike). But I don’t want to put the money into fixing it if it’s reached an age where it’s likely to regularly develop new problems as more parts wear out and break down.

So where is this bike likely to be at in its lifecycle? Is it at an age where it makes sense to put money into fixing it if I like the bike, or is this a “No way, that bike is just going to keep eating money if you insist on repairing instead of replacing” situation?

Hi all,

Earlier this year I bought a gravel ALR5 with Paradigm SL Disc wheels.

Recently I got an 'extra' pair of Paradigm Comp wheels. Reason being I got a new road bike and immediately swapped the stock Paradigm Comp wheels for Aeolus wheels. To be clear: it's not the 'Comp 25' wheels but just the 'Comp' wheels.

I'm not really that familiar with wheel specs in general (e.g. Comp 25 vs Comp) and on top of that I can't seem to find any product details on the stock Paradigm SL wheels.

I was initially thinking about selling the extra Comp wheels, but maybe these are in fact also suited for gravel and also better than the Paradigm SL wheels. In that case I'd sell the Paradigm SL wheels.

Any help appreciated!",Need advice on Bontrager wheel specs and use cases (Bontrager Paradigm SL - Comp - Comp 25),"

bicycling,"Hi guys

I'm looking for a way to convert my wattbike fit to my road bike.

Is there an online platform to do so or am I going to have to go old-school with a tape measure? The main issue is that I don't know how to establish points of reference from the wattbike to the road bike - saddle height is easy as that's from Centre of BB but the Handlebar height? 

I case anybody can assist:
Standard Wattbike Pro Handlebars and saddle
Saddle height: 20.5cm
Saddle depthkforwars backward): 0cm
Handlebar height: 10cm
Handlebar depth(forward): 3cm

bicycling,"Last week on July 4th a family was bicycling on a tandem bike on Hwy 93 north of Jackpot, Nv. The woman and her husband was riding while pulling a small trailer with a 2 year old baby and 1 year old baby. A car hit them from behind killing the woman and 2 year old on the spot, husband and 1 year old survived but in hospital (of course). 

I drive a truck on this Hwy every week and even though it’s legal to ride a bike on it, I’ve never seen a bike on that Hwy, it’s extremely dangerous to ride a bike there plus, it’s heavily traveled by semi trucks. There’s no shoulder except a small area of pavement with rumble strip then dirt, speed limit 70 mph, (there are fatalities all the time on that road as it is). You’d have to ride in the lane, all it takes is one person playing with phone, looking away, screwing around, etc to not see you in time and you’re hit. But to pull your infants in a little trailer on this Hwy? I call it absolutely insane and negligent. I unfortunately was there a few minutes after it happened and saw the bodies on the road, worst thing I’ve ever seen. 

Please use common sense when riding these highways, a lot of them are just plain unsafe and you’re playing with fire riding on those roads so don’t do it.

I'm tired of the exercise bike but I do prefer getting my cardio in by pedaling rather than running. The thing is I have no idea where to start, I didn't want to just pick up a Walmart bike on a whim without researching first but my problem is I'm honestly not even sure WHAT to research. I hadn't realized there were like 20 different styles of bike and how wide the price range is on them haha  


Looking at videos of mountain biking also piqued my interest. I definitely would be riding roads most of the time but if it's feasible I'd like to have the option to ALSO ride trails as well if I ever decided to venture into trail riding. I'm also not familiar with what sort of price I'd be paying. I'd love some recommendations on a bike that may fit me.  


Here are some details that may help:  
\-I live in the US and I'd be mostly riding roads and there are hills to account for.  
\-I'm 5' 6"" and chubby, moderate cardio health (can run 3 miles, it kills me though lol)  
\-and lastly the greatest crux that I'm sure you all love to hear, I don't necessarily want to break the bank on a bike. I'm not sure what I SHOULD be spending on a bike but at the moment I think I'd like to stay around or below the $5-600 range.

However, I have no clue where to start. How do you pick out a beginner bike? How do you learn the road rules for biking? I am from a rural area, and now that I am in a more bike friendly area, I have zero clue how to navigate. Any beginner pointers would be much appreciated.How to get into biking?"

I'm hoping this product is going to be “best in class” (no doubts on tracking, but perhaps some reservations on the other features). In my mind it’s the ideal product for a good section of the cycling community but I'm aware inventors generally tend to think that way...

So I'm looking for feedback (constructive ideally, but I'll take what I can get) to make sure that we’re somewhat on track. Any input would be very much appreciated and will in all likelihood affect the product we end up developing.

Here's the full concept with specs: [https://lightbug.io/use/personal-bike-gps-tracker/](https://lightbug.io/use/personal-bike-gps-tracker/)

I'm a new cyclist. I usually try to do 90 minutes (30ish km) every time I ride, 3 days a week.  So today on my ride I noticed my penis was completely numb. Not gonna lie this was a pretty terrifying experience.   5ish mins after the bike ride the feeling went back to normal.  I talked to a friend and he said it's common and I'm just blocking blood flow and I should get off my seat from time to time to prevent it. 

Now I'm concerned about fertility. I'm 25 male and would like to have kids in the future. I've noticed cycling is more of a middle-aged person's hobby and most of them already have kids so they don't really care about fertility but as a young person it's definitely concerning. I did a quick google search and it showed that studies have found lower sperm count in people who cycle more than 5 hours per week. I was a runner but switched to bicycling because running 30km a week was getting rough on my knees.  Might have to try out skipping lmao.

Not gonna lie this was a pretty terrifying experience.   5ish mins after the bike ride the feeling went back to normal.  I talked to a friend and he said it's common and I'm just blocking blood flow and I should get off my seat from time to time to prevent it. 

Now I'm concerned about fertility. I'm 25 male and would like to have kids in the future. I've noticed cycling is more of a middle-aged person's hobby and most of them already have kids so they don't really care about fertility but as a young person it's definitely concerning. I did a quick google search and it showed that studies have found lower sperm count in people who cycle more than 5 hours per week. I was a runner but switched to bicycling because running 30km a week was getting rough on my knees.  Might have to try out skipping lmao.

bicycling,"Some context first:

Bought an Ebike three+ years ago. It was a standard mountain bike type bicycle with 7-gears rear cassette, lowest being 14 teeth. After some months I've replaced the cassette with another brand, also 7 gears but lowest one now 11 teeth. So far so good. After many riding hours (99% on the lowest gear) the chain started skipping every once in a while. Replaced the cassette and the chain - problem gone. Rode all the way through autumn - lots of rain on components, then parked the bike for the winter. Took it out at spring - the chain once again skips every once in a while. Replaced chain - same. Replaced cassette - same. Even replaced derailleur - same.

So where would I go from here? The only original drivetrain part from the purchase date are the middle chain wheel. Time to replace that too, or is there something else obvious that I am overlooking? I've never rode on the smaller middle chain wheel, but if I drop the chain there, the skipping continues. The skipping however is not present on any cassette gear other than the 11T.

So yeah. A troubleshooting direction would be appreciate. Cheers.",Chain skipping issue - advice needed,"Some context first:

I dont know much about road biking but like to ride my bike maybe 20 mi a day 4 or 5 times a week for exercise.  I was experiencing a lot of flats and figured that with tires that were 12 or 13 years old I should switch them out haha.  I got a pair of gatorskins which ive read good and bad things about and on my second ride with new tires I got another flat!  I looked around on the tube and realized the hole came from the side that rested against the rim so I looked and saw this hole on the rim.  Its got one pretty sharp side to it, I put the tube back on and it sat right where this hole was.  

What could cause what appears to be a random hole right there?  Would I be able to maybe just get a little fine sandpaper and file it down and put some tape over it?

bicycling,"A few years ago I bought a new giant escape 2 (2018 model) for about $500 with the idea that I’d just occasionally use it to commute to work. 

Since then, I’ve managed to use it in a bunch of ways I never thought I would, and I’ve been on a bit of a (somewhat ridiculous) mission to make it as versatile as possible. 

Recently I’ve gotten into doing triathlons with this bike. I slapped a pair of aero bars and a redshift seatpost on it, and it actually works kinda well, at least for my (very modest) skill/fitness level. And I can instantly transition back to a more relaxed position if I’m going around town hauling my westie in a milk crate or my daughter in a burley.

I’m interested in getting a power meter on it to support training, but I’m not sure if there’s a good way to do it. I really like the hybrid pedals I have on it right now (Shimano eh-500), since I can use it for both pedaling around town in casual shoes and racing/training in bike shoes, so I don’t really want pedal-based sensors. Plus, it seems like all of those are close to the original cost of the bike.

I wouldn’t mind having a left-crank-based sensor, and it seems like some of them aren’t too terribly expensive (200-300 on the very low end). But I’m not sure there are any reasonably priced power-sensing cranks that are compatible with my super low end crankset (SR XCE-T318). I’d love to be mistaken on this, though.

Another not-horribly-expensive option seems to be something like a powerpod, but those seem to be pretty finicky.

Almost two years later, I’m cycling a minimum of 15 miles a day during the week and usually go for a 30-40 mile spin on the weekends. I bought a carbon fiber Savadeck off Amazon to see if I would really get into road cycling. 

Now I’m 100% confident this will be my thing probably forever. I love it. But I’m ready to upgrade to a more reputable brand for a carbon road bike.

Are they really worth the money? My Savadeck is light and quite a little speed demon. Just not sure what I would be gaining from something like a Trek or Specialized bike other than people not asking me “what brand even is Sava” at the local trails on the weekend.  Any advice is helpful! Thank you!Will I notice a significant difference upgrading to Trek, Specialized, etc?"

I'm very confused because I've never crashed on the bike. I don't understand how that could have happened. 

In any event, I've seen a lot of articles online about how steel forks (like mine) can be bent back into shape. I trust this LBS immensely but I'm wondering if they're just being too conservative with the fork. Could it be bent back into shape? Would it be dangerous?

bicycling,"Hello - thought I would post this here to get some ideas/suggestions and why not, you all have been super helpful in the past. I did try to look around but nothing quite fit my scenario so here goes.

I've got 3 weeks left in the country I currently live in (S.E. Asia) and will be moving to Italy mid-August. I have two bikes, one hybrid (Aluminum) and one road bike (Carbon frame + stem + handlebars but aluminum wheels).

I can only bring one with me on the flight and since I use it more, I'm opting for the road bike and here is where the challenge begins. the hybrid will come with the movers, that takes 2 to 3 months to arrive.

I do not have a hard case and buying one now is difficult as you all can imagine, plus expensive but that's not really an issue (will explain).

Airline will not charge extra for the bike (sporting goods), as long as its within the right dimensions when packed. If it goes over 300cm total, then it's marked as oversize and then I have to pay USD 400 for it alone.

I can get a soft case (EVOC Travel bag) second hand for about USD 400 and like the hard case, this is not easily available. There is another brand I can get - B&amp;W International Bike Case - but I know nothing of it and it costs around USD 400 (new). 

I am not sure of how much I will use the travel case after this initial move; in my mind I will be traveling all over Europe, but the reality might be vastly different, especially planning a wedding and a planning to have a second baby and looking for a new job.

Without a hard case, the airline says I need to sign off any claims to any damage whatsoever before they let me on board/check in the bike.

So, my main questions are:

1. Does anyone know this brand B&amp;W and whether their cases can survive a flight or two?
2. Is the USD 400 reasonable for the EVOC soft case (they call it hybrid), keeping in mind the general scarcity?
3. What are the chances that the bike travels ok, given now we have more people going to Europe for the summer i.e. translates to potentially more bags on top of the bike case?
4. if I can get the bike insured for the travel only, is it still worth it to deal with the hassle?
5. Lastly, should I just simply sell the damn bike as much as I love it and then face the prospect of not finding another bike for a few months (I spent a few months waiting for this)?

But my problem is that I don't know how to ride a Bicycle. It scares me, and I have 0 balance. And when I say 0 balance, I mean that I broke a leg in a 3km/h ride in a scooter. 

So, knowing that, I thought to buy a Tricycle. But I don't know if it's really more stable tan a bicycle, or if I would lose some money.  So I hope you can help me with the next questions:

Are the tricycles more stable? I could go to the mountain with it?(nothing hard, only a dirt path (I don't know the name of that on English, sorry)).

bicycling,"This evening, July 10 2022 was the first time I practiced bicycling since one short episode from 1996 or so that ended with a fall on a dirty muddy road near a decrepit apartment bloc. 

Today I spent around two hours attempting to ride a bikesharing vehicle. They are all the same form, shape and size in my area. I was successful in preventing me from falling down flat on my face but not much else.

Here is what I did: I set the saddle at the lowest possible setting, removed the stand extension that keeps it upright when it is parked, and took it for a 15-20 minute walk. After that I sat on the saddle and noticed three things: 1) within 5 minutes of handling the front handles I started having pain between my thumbs and my index fingers; 2) the saddle caused significant irritation in the perineum right away and throughout the whole ordeal; 3) even at the lowest setting the saddle only allowed me to put my feet flat with me standing up almost perfectly straight, knees not bent. Picture leaning on the saddle rather than sitting on it.

With this, I did try moving downhill to gain momentum. To do so, I first put my feet wide to prevent pedals hitting my shins, and pushed foot by foot to gain speed. While doing so I was unable to get fast enough to elevate my feet and keep the bike balanced. Instead, the vehicle began tilting left or right within a second.

Next, I tried scooting by pushing the bike with my right feet while my left feet was resting on a pedal at anywhere from 1 to 6 o clock positions at various times. This did not help either.

My scooting pace was incredibly slow, and I was passed by by pedestrians. It seems like I am unable to get enough speed to start pedalling. By the time I try to reach the pedal with my scooting foot the bike stirs aside and crashes. I was not able to start pedalling without looking at my feet, since I kept missing the pedal.

Finally, I had to give the ride 1/5 rating when the bike sharing app asked me to but the app itself is very helpful.

Further notes:

A) I did try elevating the saddle to 3-4 fingers level below my hip but it made matters worse, so I brought it back down. Namely, after elevating it I almost fell down when I began to lose balance.

B) Using handbrakes helped but I kept throttling down with either of my feet first. It is still unclear which handbrake controls which wheel.

C) I tried looking at my feet and looking ahead of me instead. Neither approach produced any significant changes. I still had to bring my attention back down to prevent falling.

D) The bike kept steering left and right randomly. As I kept trying to keep it straight the bike's weight pulled me with it, and I had to slow down and put my foot on the ground to prevent falling.

E) I was riding on a paved road designed for cyclists. No other cyclists around me seem to have experienced the same issues.

F) The bike frame was really heavy and I found it very challenging to walk it with one hand. 

Personal info: My height is 5 feet 8 inches and weight is 144 lbs. I have myopia requiring me to use glasses while working with personal computer displays but not while reading books or using a smartphone. I have never ridden a bicycle for more than a few seconds in my life before. As for physical fitness, I walk 10 to 12 miles every weekend; except for an occasional upper left side back pain after walks I do not have any complaints.

Was I doing something wrong or is this normal for the first few hours of adult bike training session?

bicycling,"Hi all

TL;DR: I want to cycle 830km of extremely flat roads in 3 days. Any tips and tricks how to stay fit and healthy?

So I've done 2 larger bike tours, one for 1000km in 8 days, 2 years ago. And one just recently, 330km in 3 days.
On my last trip I realized that I have a fairly large competitive strain that wanted me to go faster. Generally I like pushing myself and do things no ordinary person would think of. Perhaps strangely, I really enjoy everything leading up to the trip, the planning, training etc. 

So in October, my partner will have an event in Amsterdam. I told her I will meet her there, but I will cycle up. From our doorstep it's around 830km, of extremely flat and largely descending cycle way. For 90% of it, I could follow the Ev15, one of Europe's best built cycle paths.

[The route](https://ibb.co/KVKGGbt) 

So here are my questions:
Is 830km doable in 3 days, i.e. 280 km per day?
Is October to late for such a long tour?
Will it be too cold/too dark?
How would you practice for it? (I am in decent shape, but not extraordinary)

How do you structure the ride with breaks etc?

Thanks in advance!

Maybe some additional info.
- I will (hopefully, knock on wood) get my gravel bike, a canyon grizl 7, with 2x11 grx soon, which I will promptly dress in road focused tyres.
- I follow a plant based diet (please don't focus on that unless it contributes to the overall discussion), so I cant just eat 2 big steaks at the end of the day and get my protein fix.


Why am I doing it in the first place?
As mentioned, it appeals to the competitive side in me. I have always had my eye on competitive bikepacking events, such as the Tuscany Trail Event, or smaller X-divide races). So this would get me started in this world.",830km in 3 days - what to consider?,"Hi all

I'm thinking about getting a roof rack for my gf's and my own road bike for when we go on vacation. Now the question is if a bike cover is worth it to protect the bikes (mid-range priced bikes, I'd say) with a bike cover or if that is actually a waste of money? If it's worth it, do you have any recommendations?

The roof racks I'm looking at right now is the Thule TopRide specifically, if that matters.

bicycling,"I love biking so much, it helped me to lost 20 kg excess weight and get over my panic disorder. I no longer need to use high blood pressure pills etc.

I was using a borrowed downhill bike for the last 2 years and finally found the budget to get a decent road bike on last April.

Since I had my own bike, I’m super motivated. Used it around 1.5k km but never more that 50km because I usually ride during my lunch break (2 hrs).

Last weekend, I decided to go for my long waited 100k. Most of the ride was very smooth. I fed my self well, stood hydrated and didn’t have any back or neck pain.

It changed once I hit the 90th km. My legs worked just fine but suddenly I lost all the focus. My brain just stopped working and I started to look to road with empty eyes. 

Pushed myself to finish it and just 2 km away from my home I crashed.
The car in front of me signaled to left to enter a parking lot. There was enough space between me and the car for me to react but my empty brain couldn’t do anything. At last second I braked hard and tried turn left with car but it was too late. I hit the hood and rolled a couple of times. It was a horrible experience and I couldn't get up for a solid minute. I get away with a couple of scratches and only thing damaged in the bike is the bar tape.

I finished the last 2k and instead of being happy about my first 100k, I was happy that I’m alive.
It been a week and I’m still having some cold feet to go out and ride again. I would like to hear some other people who had similar problems after a crash. Did it effect you like it did to me? If yes, how did you get over it?",I finished my first 100k with a crash! Now afraid to ride,"I love biking so much, it helped me to lost 20 kg excess weight and get over my panic disorder.

Since I had my own bike, I’m super motivated. Used it around 1.5k km but never more that 50km because I usually ride during my lunch break (2 hrs).

Last weekend, I decided to go for my long waited 100k. Most of the ride was very smooth. I fed my self well, stood hydrated and didn’t have any back or neck pain.

It changed once I hit the 90th km. My legs worked just fine but suddenly I lost all the focus. My brain just stopped working and I started to look to road with empty eyes. 

Pushed myself to finish it and just 2 km away from my home I crashed.
The car in front of me signaled to left to enter a parking lot. There was enough space between me and the car for me to react but my empty brain couldn’t do anything. At last second I braked hard and tried turn left with car but it was too late. I hit the hood and rolled a couple of times. It was a horrible experience and I couldn't get up for a solid minute. I get away with a couple of scratches and only thing damaged in the bike is the bar tape.

I finished the last 2k and instead of being happy about my first 100k, I was happy that I’m alive.
It been a week and I’m still having some cold feet to go out and ride again. I would like to hear some other people who had similar problems after a crash. Did it effect you like it did to me? If yes, how did you get over it?I finished my first 100k with a crash! Now afraid to ride"
bicycling,"For years, I had this idea floating around in my head, to cycle to a festival instead of taking the car. In mid August this year, it's going down. A buddy will join me on his modified hardtail mtb. 

Total length is 215k with \~1000m/3300 feet of elevation. Surface will be almost exclusively asphalt if Komoot is to trust. Since I'd like to give ranndoneuring a go in the future, I fancy the idea of doing it in one go. Buddy is reasonably expirienced and not opposed to the idea.

I have two bikes at hand I could use:

\- A Giant Revolt gravel bike with 2x11, around 10kg and 40mm tires, 3 bottlecages + frame bag  
\- A vintage Peugeot road bike with 2x6, probably 10-11kg and 25mm tires, 2 bottlecages + trekking backpack

As for previous rides with both bikes:  
My currently longest ride ever (112k) was done on the Peugeot, but the Revolt is more comfortable by default and I did several 70-80k rides with it before. I was already set on using the Revolt, but commuting with the Peugeot in the last weeks has me thinking again. It is the faster bike, but comfort might be questionable.

What would be your pick?",What to choose for a single day 200k ride?

# Goals

* Check your physical.shape: 270 km circle, 24 h limit.
*  To get the best maps for activists — openstreetmap. 
* Perform calculations of the parameter: 📈 ""total climb"".
*  And just to inspire a part of the Reddit audience to adventure outdoor, who caught the eye of this post.

A few days ago I took a bike tour according to the training manual. Before arrival, I was getting in shape *(rolling 1000 km from spring + running)*; passed the recovery stage *(before the 'race' the whole week in everyday life and without sports activities)*; mentally prepared for the track *(yes, more psychology, not the saddle played a key role in the race)* and studied the location of the route. A day before the start, just in case, I went through the rear wheel hub and upgraded the steering wheel by making additional soft handles. And I took trains to my sister in the neighboring region.

June 23, starting at 4.30 am under the motto:

&gt;Twist it up and don't fuss, as we were taught at school, as our fathers taught.

I have successfully completed my daily bike ride *(the planned 270 km circle by the morning of the 24th at 3.30).*

On the route, speed was not important to me, aiming for a full time job: how not to twist — to keep within a day. Concurrently, I am in the top list *(rating/position)* of OSM mapers in the Russian Federation, then on the way I often slowed down to make a common contribution to the openstreetmap map, noting drinking water, tables and other adjacent POIs *(thanks to OsmAnd developers for the built-in OSM editor).*

And in one village where a glass factory operates, I had to dismount and ""drag the bike on myself"" for a kilometer *(as well as drag it in the forest along a sandy path)*. The entire Vokzalnaya Street was strewn with glass chips of a small fraction, gleaming hostilely in the rays of the afternoon sun, which put my bike trip/experiments at risk of puncture.

Here is my track, and pay attention to the total climb recorded using GPS and calculated in different software. The error of the hyperbolized height data *(we will consider it relative to the commercial sports social network STRAVA)* reaches **↑700%**, while the error in distance lies within 0.5%. Why does this happen: when the differences and heights on the graph in different software are \~ visually the same? ~~Everything due to the smoothing of peaks and roughness is similar to the suppression of higher harmonics/conversion of a random signal~~. And software, no matter commercial or scientific software, grinds them to different coefficients, but some athletes perceive the obtained figures rationally, without even thinking about the fact that the data of the total climb is an urban fantasy, a the matrix, or even sports sacrilege. The solution to this problem is for the consortium to create an updated specification and normalize algorithms for calculating the total climb: to smooth out peaks, coefficients \*\* according to a single methodology of mathematical approximation

In the world *(outside the USA)*, digital models of the earth's relief are available to users, scientists and developers under liberal licenses from NASA, such as [SRTM90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) *(grid between pixels with a resolution of 90m x 90m, less accurate, data from 2003)*; SRTM30 *(grid between pixels with a resolution of 30m x 30m, more accurate, data from 2015)* and [ALOS](https://global.jaxa.jp/) from the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency *(the grid between pixels with a resolution of 30m x 30m, but in fact even more detailed, raster data downloaded from 2021).*

As can be seen from calculations in GIS based on the NASA/JAXA dataset and calculations in third-party software, the total climb floats critically, which means it cannot be regarded as data with an acceptable error. IMHO, until the consortium agrees, creates and publishes an updated specification for calculating the cumulative set of heights, then each software will continue to ""smooth/roughen peaks"" at its discretion *(meter/two* [cubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell)*)*, misleading users, and those, in turn, each other and the enemy.

**Conclusion**: fact:: in the third decade of the twenty-first century, there is still no standardized, striving for the ideal, way to measure the total climb, which is clearly demonstrated in this article, and in each community *(Strava; ST; Polar; etc.)*, their ""false gods"" are revered.

Ride for your own pleasure, treat this parameter calmly: as a total climb *(don't get fooled by marketing / holivars)* and take care of your joints health.

# Goals

* Check your physical.shape: 270 km circle, 24 h limit.
*  To get the best maps for activists — openstreetmap. 
* Perform calculations of the parameter: 📈 ""total climb"".
*  And just to inspire a part of the Reddit audience to adventure outdoor, who caught the eye of this post.

A few days ago I took a bike tour according to the training manual. Before arrival, I was getting in shape *(rolling 1000 km from spring + running)*; passed the recovery stage *(before the 'race' the whole week in everyday life and without sports activities)*; mentally prepared for the track *(yes, more psychology, not the saddle played a key role in the race)* and studied the location of the route. A day before the start, just in case, I went through the rear wheel hub and upgraded the steering wheel by making additional soft handles. And I took trains to my sister in the neighboring region.

June 23, starting at 4.30 am under the motto:

&gt;Twist it up and don't fuss, as we were taught at school, as our fathers taught.

I have successfully completed my daily bike ride *(the planned 270 km circle by the morning of the 24th at 3.30).*

On the route, speed was not important to me, aiming for a full time job: how not to twist — to keep within a day. Concurrently, I am in the top list *(rating/position)* of OSM mapers in the Russian Federation, then on the way I often slowed down to make a common contribution to the openstreetmap map, noting drinking water, tables and other adjacent POIs *(thanks to OsmAnd developers for the built-in OSM editor).*

And in one village where a glass factory operates, I had to dismount and ""drag the bike on myself"" for a kilometer *(as well as drag it in the forest along a sandy path)*. The entire Vokzalnaya Street was strewn with glass chips of a small fraction, gleaming hostilely in the rays of the afternoon sun, which put my bike trip/experiments at risk of puncture. I was surprised that some locals somehow did not notice the glass with its playfully crystal luster under their feet.

The ongoing issue is that the puncture reopens, pisses sealant, I stop and spin the tire to reseal it, I put air in to keep riding, and about ten minutes later my tire is pissing sealant again. This has happened a few rides in a row now and it’s getting old. 😄
My previous tires, Vitoria Rubino Pro, never had an issue.

However, while cars (usually) slow to a safe speed while passing, this car was going slower than normal.

Since nobody was coming from behind us or from the opposite lane, they were able to ride next to me for a good 30 seconds or so and we had a mini-conversation. She never stopped smiling! 

The mom emailed me later in the day to let me know how excited she was to see me on my bicycle! She said the daughter was nervous I wouldn’t see her waving, but she didn’t want to scream out the window and startle me lol. She’s very mature for her age, some kids would’ve screamed out the window lol. She waited until I saw her before she started talking.
