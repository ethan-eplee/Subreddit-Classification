The time has come to replace the padding in my Shoei Hornet X2 again. I've got the OE size 35mm cheek pads already HOWEVER the OE size 9mm crown seems to be back order to oblivion in my area. I see there's also a listing for a 13mm XL crown.... anyone made the switch and have the helmet become way to tight?

motorcycles,"I’m learning to ride and have been experiencing different ways of slowing down. I reached out and got some helpful insight but would like some more clarification. My instinct is just to pull in the clutch because I know the bike can’t go any faster without it being engaged. From there I’ll just drop all the gears until I reach first. I don’t know if going from 5–&gt;1st gear is bad for the bike if I end up not stopping and can just roll back on the throttle. 

However, I’ve been trying to downshift “more properly” if you will, incase I need to speed away or make a maneuver, but my instinct then would be to just dump the clutch and throttle. Idk what makes the bike stall but I feel like I can stall from being in 4th gear when I should be in 2nd or 6th but I’m not sure if that’s true or not. 

The reason I’m having trouble stopping is when I let off the throttle, I feel a harsh braking sensation already and my rpms are dropping fast (I have no cruise control, just ABS). Then at that point I decide to downshift and it isn’t the smoothest because once I let the clutch out, I feel I’ve slowed down significantly and at this point I feel there are no needs to use either brake since the rpms are getting lower and I’m gonna downshift again. Maybe I’m downshifting too early, I’m not exactly sure if there is a proper time to do it so help would be appreciated. 

However, I’m riding in the city where there are lights after lights and gradual inclines and declines. I was stopped at one light, it turned green and I was accelerating where the speed limit is 55mph going downhill and I was still accelerating when a light changed on me and I was inbetween where you could go both ways but blowing through the intersection didn’t seem the smarter of the two and I decided to brake. I didn’t slam on my brakes, I gradually pulled them in and at the same time I just pulled in the clutch and started dropping gears. By the time I could fully stop I was halfway in the intersection and just decided to run it (not something I’d like to do again).

My question is if this was the best way to stop and should I have even worried about dropping gears or could I have just pulled the clutch in and dropped to first once I was stopped.",What’s the fastest/safest way to brake quickly if needed?,"I’m learning to ride and have been experiencing different ways of slowing down. I reached out and got some helpful insight but would like some more clarification. My instinct is just to pull in the clutch because I know the bike can’t go any faster without it being engaged. From there I’ll just drop all the gears until I reach first. I don’t know if going from 5–&gt;1st gear is bad for the bike if I end up not stopping and can just roll back on the throttle.

motorcycles," I just opened the box to a new helmet I bought online. I knew right away I would probably return it. I have two other helmets that I use for dualsport riding but I wanted something more of a street style plus my old one is getting dirty. I saw one for sale that advertised a ""built-in"" Bluetooth module for communications.  I was looking for one that would not fall off like my other unit on the other helmet. It's not built in at all. It was even in a separate box that I was supposed to install onto the helmet.  The ad said built-in, but the only thing I see built-in is cheap plastic and sharp edges. It's such junk it went right back in the box and I'm printing up the return label now.

I'm not naming the shipper; they didn't make it. And the name of the helmet I've never heard of. I should have known better. But for $162. I thought it would not be that bad. Ya, I know I should have spent $500. It would be fine for riding a moped or kids scooter, and it was DOT approved but I guess inflation is real and I should stick with known name brands and pay the price for a better one.",Low quality helmet I just bought.," I just opened the box to a new helmet I bought online.

motorcycles,"I had set aside all my activities for the entire past weekend in order to focus on the basic rider course I had long been looking forward to. The class portion of the program went fine, but the following day as I arrived to the field portion of the class, one of the instructors took issue with my footwear.

Mind you, I purchased these boots for the sole purpose of attending this course. They appeared to provide good protection for the ankles and I had no doubt in my mind that they would have passed a footwear check. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

The class portion of the program went fine, but the following day as I arrived to the field portion of the class, one of the instructors took issue with my footwear.

Mind you, I purchased these boots for the sole purpose of attending this course. They appeared to provide good protection for the ankles and I had no doubt in my mind that they would have passed a footwear check. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

First, I want to install a U-type chain link to the wall so instead I'd secure the bike to the wall instead to itself. But how much better that is? Also, how can I secure it even more? E.g. what can I do to prevent someone, say, with a hex key simply unscrewing the wall link?

Second, I was eyeing some GPS systems which give precise location, or some even more advanced systems with remote kill switches. Are they worth the money? Or a simple tamper alarm would be enough?

I want to get back on the horse and get another bike whenever insurance pays out, as riding has been one of the few things that bring me joy recently, but I have both family and friends insisting I don't and buy a car instead. Just very torn on what to do going forward and would appreciate any advice or input y'all haveFirst Bad Accident"
motorcycles,"As the title says.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a CB650F with an Ixil X55 aftermarket exhaust.

&amp;#x200B;

I previously inserted the DB killer and the screw fell into the housing, causing me to have to remove the entire exhaust then and there and shake the screw out (30min of shaking).

&amp;#x200B;

It has a very tight space for the screw, as it is located right by the arm. The only way to unscrew it is a 30° Torx wrench. It also comes with a metal washer, which is even more of an issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions?",How to remove the DB killer screw without it falling into the housing,"As the title says.

motorcycles,"Hey, riders.

The valve of my front tyre has broken off so it was a good indication to replace the tyres. I've been searching my city for a while now, but I haven't found the exact ones I'm riding on. I drive a Kawasaki ZX6R on 190/55 ZR 17, but the closest I was able to find are 190/50. Would I still be able to fit them on? My experience with these kinds of issues is only comparable to that of a novice, so I hope reaching out here will offer advice from the more experienced/educated riders.

motorcycles,"so i have been looking at getting a DRZ400sm and the biggest thing i am worried about is it not having enough up and go power for me to have fun with. 

So short explanation. my buddy got a CB500, and my cb1000 is just too far above it and i have been wanting rid of it for a while anyway. So, i have been looking at smaller bikes, trying not to go over 70hp cause above that it will just destroy the 500 and i want us to be pretty equal. 

I have looked at the SV650, and MT07, and a few smaller displacement bikes. And in my gut the DRZ pulls at me cause i started on Dirt and know my way around a dirtbike platform, and i have gotten a lot of pavement experience in the past 2 years, so i feel confident i can blend that into the perfect cornering machine. 

But i fear the DRZ is just not right for me in the way that it just lacks in power and is expensive when i can just get a SV650 for the same price and be setting almost identical to his 500. but then back at the DRZ I feel like the cornering ability of that bike will be worth it. 

So to sum this all up Cornering worth more on the DRZ or should i go for more power?

I also can't get the thought out of my head of beating my local Harley riders in a race on a 400cc bike. cause on the cb they always say it aint fair cause it revs so high. they just can't take a turn and won't admit it, so on the DRZ it would just put those Harley riders to shame and i would love it. 

and thinking on this more, if i can hone my abilities enough and get on the right roads there is a good chance i can take out some big boy bikes, and i think that would feel so empowering over winning with the bike that has more power. 

The further i write the more i loose a main target of this post, at this point i just kind of want to debate everyone's thoughts on cornering over power and what you guys thing is truly more rewarding. id like to hear what you guys think, and your honest opinions on what you think is better.","Power or Cornering? what is more rewarding?

I am a proud owner of a really sexy motorcycle that I love dearly. During summer I always park her at the front of the house where everyone can see her 24/7 for 6 months. Its a semi busy street. 

Luckily I live in a ""good"" neighbourhood with very little crime. But I´ve heard thats its fairly easy to steal a bike. I mean you can literally bring 2 buddies, pick it up and you are gone.

So my question is, how easy/hard is it to steal a bike? And which safety measurements do you guys use to prevent theft ? 

Thanks!",How easy/hard is it to steal a bike?,"Hello Hello,

motorcycles,What would you choose? Currently have a Cb300f and having a hard time choosing my next bike. I like the naked style obviously but I’m not interested in the more powerful Hondas (haven’t heard good things) and I like the look of these 3 better. I’m more interested in reliability as opposed to the “fun factor” because I’m sure all 3 of these are reasonably fun bikes to ride. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Mt07 vs Z650 vs SV650,What would you choose?

motorcycles,"I just switched from a ninja 250 (after riding it for almost 2 full seasons) to an FZ07. Its been a handling  adjustment for me for sure. On sunday, about 2 weeks into owning it I chose to go for a longer ride and ended up having to call my dad to pick me up because I felt like my handling was off and I didn't feel comfortable, which I haven't had to do on this bike or any others prior to this.

A couple days later, I rode it again. I had no issues and thoroughly enjoyed the ride, even did some parkinglot maneuvers (u-turns and the works) with no issue and I felt like I was handling it well.

The day after that, I chose to ride to work. I hit a pothole on the freeway and got pulled sharply to the left because it turned my wheel. I let off the throttle and feathered my rear break while i turned the wheel back so i could resume proper lane position, but before I completed the fix I realized the car behind me had not slown down and was very, very close to me. My reflexes kicked in and I turned my wheel towards the meridian to of the freeway to avoid being rear ended and still, the car barely missed me. They didnt so much as pull over at the next pullout, very shortly up the road.

Yes, I know I am the one who initially screwed up, wether or not it was because of the pothole. But I really feel the car should've either slown down or switched lanes (no cars in the other lane) and at the very least the should've pulled over at the pullout.

I got my leg sandwiched between my bike and the meridian which cut it up kinda bad, but asides from that and being extremely stiff/sore I'm okay, and my bike is fixable.

I truly believe I did the right thing getting out of the way because if they had rear ended me if could've been fatal. But its still so hard to accept the fact I rode my bike at 100km/h (60mph) into a meridian, purposefully. Knowing I couldn't stop in time. This close call with my brand new bike paired with the bad ride I had 2 rides prior I'm honestly wondering if I should just hang up my keys and try again next season.

Thoughts or advice?",I crashed my motorcycle.

Not after a hardcore sports bike, think I ultimately want something like a Speed Triple, Monster 1200, Sportster S/Fatbob etc. But they don't seem like sensible places to start. So what do we reckon?

I was vaguely thinking about a Street Triple, or should I start smaller?

ThanksWhat bike do I want?"
motorcycles,"I have a KLR 650, 2002 with 18k miles. I bought it around a month ago. I removed the drain plug today during an oil change and a chunk of metal came out attached to the drain plug magnet. It looks like a 1/4 of a ring, about the size of a little finger nail.

What could this be?

motorcycles,"Hi, I’m 23(F) and I’ve been wanting to get a Vespa for about 4 years now but haven’t gotten around to it yet - I don’t know where to start. I’m not sure what kind of model I would get, yet. I live in Southern California. I don’t intend to use this for long distance travel or heavy freeway use, just more of a cruising bike. 

I’m a bit confused on differing info I’ve read online on what needs to be done. Being 23, do I need to take an online course first? Or do I just go and take the written / actual driving test on my motorcycle (?)… I would 100% do an in-person course anyway, just to gain experience and learn hands on, since I and no one in my family has rode before (so I have no one to learn from).

My first question. How normal is it to be dragging floorboards through tight cornering and U turns. And does it scare the shit out of anyone else? 
Second question, is it possible to put on adv style saddle bags on my cruiser, or is that just weird?",cruisers questions,"So I guess just a couple questions for those of you who ride cruisers.

motorcycles,"As the title says is it dangerous for the motorcycle i.e. is there any long-term damage to the transmission etc ? I was biking down from a hill station and decided to keep the bike on first gear while keeping the clutch pressed and it started making a strange sound. Another thing I realised is the if i just let it ride itself on neutral (and since the slope was steep the speed would go beyond what I would normally let it reach at 1st gear) and try to shift to the 1st gear there was an extreme ""friction sound"" like a chainsaw when I tried to shift to 1st gear and the motorcycle wouldn't  let me and consequently I didn't force it beyond that as i thought it would damage it. I'm still a noob and I think that this is due to the ""high-speed"" caused by the slope and the 1st gear in my motorcycle isn't meant to drive at such speeds. 


Have I damaged the motorcycle and should I avoid doing this ?

I panicked a bit, down shifted from 4th to 2nd (I thought before I started to lean, but I honestly can’t say for sure at this point) and when I let the clutch out I lost traction on my rear tire. I want to say I was going somewhere around 40 into a 10mph turn. 

I was somehow able to stop without crashing or dropping the bike but I honestly have no idea how. It was all a blur.

So I grab my wrenches, start taking stuff off and eventually get to taking the bolts off of the front sprocket cover. Hmmm pretty straight forward so far.

As I lift the sprocket cover away from the bike, cue both the washer and the ENTIRE FUCKING SPROCKET NUT just straight up falling onto the ground with the loudest \*ping\*. [I can still hear the metal ringing in my ears.](https://i.giphy.com/media/l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS/giphy.webp)

That shit wasn't even screwed in a single thread, let alone torqued down. Guessed the sprocket was seized enough onto the splines of the transmission output that it didn't pop off...but thinking back, she we went full throttle a couple times while it was like this. 😳

motorcycles,"I have a 2018 Fat Boy 114, a bike that is my only vehicle(not including my little escooter and electric bike I dont ride anymore.)

It has the stock wheels on it, which are solid scalloped dish wheels. They're pretty big, and accomindate really fat tires.

I used to daily (ride)drive the bike, but circumstances in life turned into me not needing to daily commute anymore, but my bike being my only vehicle, If I gotta get somewhere, rain or shine, I ride.

So needless to say, I've ridden in heavy cross winds and ridden past plenty of semi trucks.

And I have never once noticed cross winds affecting me on my bike. Infact I've had more of an issue with my electric bike than my Fat Boy.

So come to my surprise that I hear people complain/warn people about this as an issue... all the time by people who from what it seems, has never ridden a motorbike with solid discs wheels before.

I've seen people swear up and down left and right that it catches crosswinds and made them almost lose control, but... I've ridden in 30mph+gusts and didn't have an issue.

I've ridden past plenty of Semi trucks, including some with dual trailers and I've not had a wind gust hit me hard enough to make me wander around the blacktop.

So where does this come from? I've ridden with my bike fully loaded pack on the backseat and a pack on the luggage rack.

I've had much more of an issue being noticeably blown around on my little electric bike, but never had an issue on the Fat Boy.

I'm not particularly big, at 128lbs and 5ft10in. Maybe body size has something to do with it? But then wouldn't that be not the wheels but a large rider catching the wind?","Why do so many people say a Solid Disc wheels make your bike get blown around(more than other bikes)?

And I was born with a heart condition called aortic stenosis. at 6 years old I had open heart surgery to change my aortic valve. Wich prohibits me from working any job. My monthly checks are strictly for living purposes. And before you put me down. Please understand as a man it takes a lot to break me down to a point to ask for such a handout. But Iv always loved bikes growing up. Iv always wanted a Honda cbr 600r. Or something of the sort. If you could please spread my story so that I may get recognition to receive donations to be able to have a passion outside of being inside all day. My condition make it as to where I can’t do most physical activities. In fear of sudden heart failure. Above is my gofund me link. Any donation or support spreading my story is whole heartedly appreciated thank you for taking time out of your day to read my story,Help me start my passion,Above is my story on why Iv always wanted to get into motorcycles and why I’m not able to work for one myself.

motorcycles,Just got a brand new bike and compared to my old bike the clutch lever feels EXTREMELY easy to pull in. There is proper play so that isn't an issue. It's just that there is basically no resistance when pulling the lever. Maybe I'm just used to having an older bike where it took a little more effort to pull the lever so I'm not sure but is this normal?,How easy should the clutch lever be to pull in?,Just got a brand new bike and compared to my old bike the clutch lever feels EXTREMELY easy to pull in.

motorcycles,"Swapping chains shouldn't be a big deal, even on a bike that's on the heavier side. I swapped the sprockets out two days ago and wanted to do the chain today. A wise friend of mine suggested when I break the old chain that I line up the new one right then and there and just assemble it on the bike. Sound advice. This afternoon I decided to get to work and promptly forgot that, and instead did the following:

- I broke the old chain and then laid it out carefully on the workbench. Then I laid the new one next to it for length. I made sure to count the links to account for stretching and double check before I broke off the extra links of the new one. Measure twice cut once and all that. I do have a chain breaker tool that also doubles as the joiner/crusher tool, so I figured I'd be fine.

- Once I broke the new chain to length, I very cleverly assembled it from the comfort of the workbench. Then I wandered over to the bike and remembered that the chain on this bike has to go through the swingarm. Ugh. I'm going to have to take the swingarm off. I sighed and dug out the engine hoist, moving it into position. 

- After staring at the right place to hook the bike up for 20 minutes, I hoisted it up and removed the axle bolt holding the swingarm on. It was at this point I realized that the chain literally has to go THROUGH the swingarm linkage. There's a triangular hole where the bottom half of the chain travels. Removing the swingarm had accomplished nothing. I would have to start all over again from scratch. Actually worse than from scratch, because I had to put the swingarm back on.

- Turns out lining up swingarm holes from the engine hoist is a bit fussy. Decided I had to remove the rear shock to gain more freedom of movement.

- After much grunting and sweating, I was able to line up the swingarm enough to get the axle bolt through and tighten it down. I then reinstalled the rear shock. Lower the bike back onto the rearstand and put the engine hoist away.

- I had to re-break the new chain, and then route it through the aforementioned swingarm hole. 

- I put a large flat wooden board across the top of the swingarm to act as a makeshift workbench for chain reassembly on the bike near ground level. Do I own a bike stand? Why, yes. But I didn't use it to start because I make good decisions. So now I'm grunting and sweating on my knees on the fatigue mat and the stupid nitrile gloves keep ripping.

- Finally get the chain reassembled. 

- Now I get to put the rear wheel on by myself which, many of you know, is all sort of fun to align the rear brake and the axle holes while not dropping the freshly greased axle on the dirty shop floor.

From there it's the usual process of tensioning the chain, putting the covers back on, and triple checking I didn't forget anything.

motorcycles,"New rider, while practicing in a parking lot today I low sided while doing a \~15mph right turn. I'm guessing I hit debris in the turn as the parking lot is falling apart and has small patches of grass and dust/gravel. It shook me up as I've never fallen before (Passed the MSF w no trouble). But I got back on after inspecting for damage and continued practicing a bit (albeit slower and scanning the ground more attentively) before heading back home to clean some small road rash. I 'm gonna buy a jacket tomorrow **😅** 

I'm wondering if it really was caused by debris or if it was me possibly being choppy with the throttle. It happened so fast that I can't really recall what happened. I have dual sport tires so I didn't think debris this small would affect me that much. I wish I had a gopro so I could have seen what I did wrong. Checked tire pressures and they are \~2psi lower than ""max pressure"". 

Feeling pretty dumb/embarrassed right now... I can only imagine what would've happened had I been on a real road doing road speeds.

Long story short, one of my stock rear wheel bearing measures 52.50mm outer diameter, and width is 15.00mm. (Also 20 inner diameter)
Well I went to buy some wheel bearings to this place, I changed 2 of them decided not to cheap out and the one that was supposed to be 52.50 is 52.00mm, I realized once I got home and placed it inside of the wheel. (The guy measured incorrectly I suppose), dumb move from me of not measuring it at the store but it happens.
Would it be fine to place the 52.00? Or is .50mm a LOT of play for a wheel bearing and too risky?

motorcycles,"Hey everyone, I purchased a salvage title 04 1100 and it runs and drives fine but the neutral safety switch has to be bypassed and the sky blue wire grounded to the frame. I bought a new neutral switch from yamaha and put it in with zero luck. I need the neutral light to come off to pass the salvage inspection and it can only be ridden right now with it bypassed so the light stays on in every gear. I checked the side safety switch and ohmed it out to make sure it has continuity and I also tried another side stand switch from a wrecked vstar 1100 which made no difference at all. So to break it down the neutral stays on constantly and can be ridden no problem if I ground the netrual safety switch but in order to pass inspection the neutral light needs to come off and it needs to shut off when the stand is down in gear. I can get the neutral light to go on in neutral and off in gear when the bike isn't started fully but as soon I fire it up and put it in gear the bike shuts off. I've been told it may be a diode but I don't even know where to start looking now.

motorcycles,"so I just had my first riding at the msf course, and all was well during the first ~3 hours. I was loving it, until my bike was switched due to the bike I had originally having problems with it being in false neutral.

cutting to the point, I stalled a bunch of times, dropped my bike a couple of times, and was having a hard time following instructions because my mind started to stress and get clogged up mid to late way through our course. the main thing that got to me was putting in power as I released the clutch. it was very, very hard for me to find that sweet spot, but on the other bike I didn't have to put in power, I just hit the friction zone and go. this bike, however, was very difficult for me, so I stalled numerous of times and I could tell one of the instructors was getting frustrated.

when the instructor (that was getting frustrated) told me to go towards the curb and to a yellow T line (where we would park), I just went straight to gain momentum, and planned to take a turn and then line up. the instructor really did not like that and starting yelling at me, telling me that we talked about the instructions literally a couple seconds ago, and that I don't follow their instructions, etc.

I'll admit, I had a couple of hiccups and forgetfulness because of the already added stress of having to adapt to a bike I wasn't used to and was harder for me to get used to plus the scorching weather, but now I'm just stressed about tomorrow since it's the test tomorrow, and the fact that I have to meet the instructor again tomorrow adds onto another layer of anxiety.

motorcycles,"So I bought an aftermarket exhaust for my bike.  It turns out that the exhaust is for the correct year, but there were differences in the breadbox of the bike in Europe and the USA models.  This one fits on, but it's not a great fit, and a little bit of air leaks out at the bottom when it's turned on (see attached picture).  I bought it from Italy and I'm in the US, so it would probably be a real pain to return.  My friends are saying that I should keep it because it sounds great and looks good.  And I know it's on there snug as I tightened the bracket so much that it bent the metal a bit.

Despite daily driving a manual coyote Mustang the last 8 years I had a lot of trouble with the clutch. I just kept on stalling. 

I didn’t realize how small the friction zone would be, and HOW FAR AWAY the bite point would be. My fingers could barely reach around the lever, and the bite point was at the very end (or beginning of the pull, farthest from the handle bar). The smallest little pull of the clutch lever would start the engagement.

The lever was so far that I could not keep my palm behind the handle bar. I had to keep it on top towards the front side and press down on it to allow for grip to pull lever. 

It was much further than a bicycle brake my at least 2 inches.

I have no hope of hearing anything but wind noise over about 35 mph.  I can’t hear the bike’s motor, my horn or any traffic (even trucks).   

The buffeting sounds even louder than sticking my head out of the window of a moving car or going full tilt on a powerboat.  

I’ve tried several different types of earplugs, some of which make it a little more tolerable.  But after 45 minutes of riding around town, my ears ring like I’ve been at a rock concert.  

I’ve also tried holding my hand against the base of the helmet and neck, which seems to change the amount of buffering but I’ve only done one side at a time.  

New HJC helmet that fits well. Kawasaki EX 500.  

Has anyone else successfully dealt with noise like this?  What did you do?  I do t remember this when I used to ride 20 years ago.

Link to original post if anyone is interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/trz8nq/facing\_my\_fears/](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/trz8nq/facing_my_fears/)

I appreciated all the comments, especially the ones encouraging me to stick with it. Because I have stuck with it quite a bit, even got to buying some cones and practicing slow speed maneuvering on the weekends with one of my coworkers. Fast forward 4 months after the original post, and I've already commuted to work and back twice with no issues and loved it so much that I actually can't wait to go to work now! The second day of commuting, I even felt comfortable enough to lane split (which is legal here in California) continuously for about 2 miles of continuous traffic, even passing one of my coworkers in a car who left work about 15 minutes before I did.

A lot of my apprehension at first had to do with my gear just feeling heavy (because it was winter when I purchased it, and was no longer winter once I started riding), so once I made the switch to a lighter mesh jacket for warmer days, and lighter gloves that made holding the grips feel more natural, and lighter boots that actually allowed me to feel the gear shifter more to get better at shifting, it has gotten so much better. 

I am so glad to have taken on this journey and continuing to stick with it. I look forward to every ride now and don't care about going as fast, but rather just enjoying every ride at a relaxed speed with a relaxed posture on my cruiser. I've even been riding to and from the gym after hard workouts, and the relaxed ride and the soft vibrations help me feel better after a workout. I've taken it to my local place of worship to attend the services. I've even taken it grocery shopping and made things fit in my two medium sized saddle bags. 

I've already made a list of mods I wanna make to the bike (higher more relaxed handlebars, bigger bags, etc) and trying to budget it all with the wife. She didn't like the idea of it all when I first brought up the idea of a bike, and later shared that her dislike of it had to do with her father who got in a couple of accidents on a bike years ago. She eventually caved and agreed to us making the purchase for a bike after seeing how much I disliked my commute to work. Seeing that I'm being responsible on the bike, going ATGATT for every single ride, and coming home in one piece and in a better mood, she has warmed up to the idea a lot more than when I first discussed it with her. Now it's just a matter of telling her how much money I'm gonna need for all the mods I'm going to make.

I'm even looking into a Go Pro mount so I can share some of the awesome scenery I get to witness on my ride to work. I thought it looked great from a car, but being able to see it from my bike is just something else.

motorcycles,"Had an accident yesterday while lane splitting in dead stop traffic. Luckily I was only going 35mph. 

She whipped out about 2 car lengths ahead and I was unable to stop all the way and had barely enough momentum to flip over the front as I bumped her bumper. Misty is cosmetically broken and the shifter windscreen mirror etc.
Hands and wrist hurt, and a bit of my shoulder, but otherwise I'm okay. Armored jacket for the win. My insurance says hers will cover everything.

I only questioned riding again for a moment after the accident and decided I need something faster and just stick to the track for a while.

motorcycles,I recently bought a 2022 Ninja 650 (about a month ago) as a first bike. I have been riding dirt bikes my entire life so I’m not a total beginner noob. The bike is great but honestly I was expecting a little more out of it. Thinking about trading it back to the dealer for a ZX6R for that extra juice and more aggressive style. I made a few calls and the dealer said they can only offer me about $6k for the bike. It seems a bit low considering I purchased the bike brand new less than a month ago and it still has under 500 miles and hasn’t been dropped.

motorcycles,"I got myself a 2021 yamaha mt09 as my first bike last year. I've wanted to start taking trips and the seat is a little tiring after a bit so I decided to upgrade and couldn't find much but corbin did custom work. liking the look i used the configurator and set up my order. The colors they have on the website say they might not match as some screens show them differently so naturally I loaded up the setup on every screen in the house they looked the same on all of them therefore it must look like that right?  Not even close.

Not only do they acknowledge that the picture on their site is not even close to the actual color, they try to blame it on the lighting, saying that in a different light it looks closer. I've had this stupid thing for 2 days doesn't matter how light or dark the area is it looks like baby blue silver. I called them trying to rectify the situation and they were adamant that that was the color and even though its wrong on the site it is entirely my fault and mine alone, so they offered a hell of a deal.

For a meager $280 dollars plus shipping on top of the $730 it cost the first time they would reskin, because no matter what you do they sold it, it is out of their hands, they do not care, and will not fix nor return it. An additional $280 which I can't at all afford at the moment but I tell them to send me the form and I'll pay it because what else can I do. They email the form now its $310 to reskin it plus an additional $50 for them to ship it back.

motorcycles,"I'm a Brit that's recently moved to California, so I'm just learning my way around the registration &amp; paperwork side of vehicle ownership here - I've got a car sorted out &amp; next up is a bike!

Looking at buying a DR350 which hasn't been registered in quite a while, so I just wanna check what the deal is with back fees and what the process would be in getting it back on the road again.

The seller describes the bike as ""does not have its licence plate but this is a factory street legal motorcycle with signed California title ready for the next owner. It’s way out of the system had not been registered since the 90’s, Already had  a CHP vin verification marked as street bike.""

Having read up on what I'd need to do to be road legal I think it would be:

\- I'd need to insure it, no problem with that, got some quotes already.

\- Would I need to pay the registration back fees? Or as it was just not registered for all that time, would there not be backfees to pay? Not sure if backfees would apply to me as I did not own the bike at the time it was not registered.

\- Would it be subject to any roadworthiness tests? I thought it would at least need a smog but the DMV site says this is not necessary.

\- I also noticed that the DMV site says I'd need a valid California motorcycle licence to register the bike but the details are a bit unclear about how I'd convert my British motorcycle licence to the California one (ie. would I need to take another test, or is it an admin exercise? Can't find an answer to this) (they let me register my car with my UK licence, maybe its the same for this?)

\- What else have I missed!?

motorcycles,"Just picked up a high mileage bike for the purpose of learning it mechanically and seeing to its flaws before I get a lower mileage one. I got it for $2000 with 81k miles. Yes I know, too expensive, but fuck it, I had the money and really wanted. 

Anyways it runs strong and the only issue it had was 

-Throttle cable being stretched/frayed 

-Clutch cable loose as well as the rod by the kickstand 

-Rear brake inoperable

Mind you I fixed all of these problems. The bike is missing a lot of screws here and there, is falling apart cosmetically (cheap plastic breaking) 

How long can this bike last with the mileage on it now? Before the engine goes out? I don’t see any compression issues, timing issues with timing chain, valve sticking issues, etc. 

Any other major or minor maintenance I should look into other than oil changing and brake changing? 

I was told that I can’t go in neutral when I want to park or come to a full stop because I need an oil change, is this true? 

Either way I’m not going to give in to the negative comments people say about high mileage being bad. I have put lots of miles on my 500hp+ bmw while it’s tuned and everything and has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever had, because I take care of it.

My current physiology at 54yo makes riding the Duc a tad uncomfortable and it should find a new home with a better suited rider.  The TW is great and love it, but if I find a bike that does both pavement and dirt well, I may not need the TW.  

My current geographic location only has dirt/gravel roads for 'theoretical' off road riding, which is fine as I have very limited experience in that area.  Also, I doubt I would have the courage to just leave the highway for some arbitrary dirt road that goes off into the middle of nowhere, especially since I ride solo.  Though I'm certainly not opposed to riding off road trails as such, if it's an area often used by others, for safety reasons.

I know the vast majority of riding will be pavement, but want a bike that can deal with the crappiest and poorly maintained roads, because I've been on those roads will riding the Duc and it was torture.  So anything I get needs to be able deal with the worst of surface conditions without much of a problem.  The intent is extended road trips.

As of late I've been looking closely at the Aprilia Taureg 660 as a do it all, jack of all trades and have considered the Tiger 850.

I also thought it would be a good preface because I can't just take it to a dealer, and there's one place in town that will look at it and I have to wait a few days because they're booked. 

I bought the bike used and rode it a lot already (600 miles). All at once I had the battery die and the lights mostly stopped working. When the battery died, I was able to kickstart the bike to drive to get a battery and I noticed the rear light, front running light, and high beam were not working. 

All four blinkers are LED and working fine. The headlight is LEDs with a ring and the ring is all that's working after replacing the battery. The rear light has the only light bulb, and both filaments burned. I've only been riding during the day so I replaced the battery and light bulb while waiting for my appointment with the mechanic and yesterday I noticed the rear running light isn't working. I pulled off the light cover and, sure enough, one of the two filaments is burned. 

I've checked the new battery, and the voltage isn't going too high. I've also checked the wiring around the headlight and can't figure out what's wrong. Admittedly all I've been able to do is check visually, as I haven't figured out how to test the wires with a device.

I also thought it would be a good preface because I can't just take it to a dealer, and there's one place in town that will look at it and I have to wait a few days because they're booked. 

I bought the bike used and rode it a lot already (600 miles). All at once I had the battery die and the lights mostly stopped working. When the battery died, I was able to kickstart the bike to drive to get a battery and I noticed the rear light, front running light, and high beam were not working. 

All four blinkers are LED and working fine. The headlight is LEDs with a ring and the ring is all that's working after replacing the battery. The rear light has the only light bulb, and both filaments burned. I've only been riding during the day so I replaced the battery and light bulb while waiting for my appointment with the mechanic and yesterday I noticed the rear running light isn't working. I pulled off the light cover and, sure enough, one of the two filaments is burned. 

I've checked the new battery, and the voltage isn't going too high. I've also checked the wiring around the headlight and can't figure out what's wrong. Admittedly all I've been able to do is check visually, as I haven't figured out how to test the wires with a device.

motorcycles,"Today I was on the way back home from the supermarket, going 55 km/h on a road where I had the right of way. On the right side of the road there were two people on bicycles waiting to pass. I made eye contact with the one in front, who then darted across the road at a safe distance from me. The second one however, never even bothered to look to her left, did not hear my 650cc single with aftermarket exhaust approaching, and took off slow as hell. Only the noise from my engine braking got her to look up with a dumb smile on her face. She got to about 0.5 meters into the road with her front wheel before coming to a stop.

At this point I slowed down to about 30 km/h and my options were to either come to a full stop and let her pass, or to pass in front of her. There were some cars behind me and I had the right of way anyway so I went for the second option and slowly started accelerating. 

Then, again without looking, this dumbass starts cycling again forcing me to emergency brake. Luckily no accident happened but earlier on the way to the supermarket somebody in a big Mercedes van was riding my ass, and the thought of these two events happening at the same time kinda ruined my afternoon.

motorcycles,"I'm not here to flame the class wars, just wanted to share my perspective. 

I've been riding on and off for 20 years with multiple tens of thousands of miles behind me with no incidents. I've now crashed a bike for the very 1st time. Welcome to the club! I was wearing full gear, but still suffered a chipped ankle, a sprained ankle, and a terribly dislocated shoulder alongside some minor road rash. I've got one good limb! My bike was over 15 years old (cheap), only had liability insurance (cheap and stupid, I guess), and I have no medical insurance (don't make enough to afford it, make to much for state assistance). That's my situation in a nutshell.

Let's look at the monetary setbacks I've since incurred: 1) towing was $450 + $30/day for storage. I've decided to pay $150 and sign the bike over to the towing company. I'm sure I'm getting ripped off, but I'm not trying to pay over $700 for a project bike. 2) medical bills are over $65 THOUSAND! $65,000... 3) I'm not working for at least a month so there's all that lost revenue. 

So yeah... Riding around on grandpa's old Harley ain't a thing anymore iffn you're not ready to pay, pay, pay.

motorcycles,"Been getting the urge to trade in my CB650R and give the Street Triple a go. My local Triumph dealer has a few different used Triples in stock and I’m debating between 2 of the ones they have. A 2020 R LRH model with 1700miles for $9800 or a 2018 RS model with 7500 miles for $10000. I’m about 5’ 10” with a 29.5” inseam and I’m not particularly worried about the height. Iv sat on a RS before and couldn’t flat foot it but felt comfortable enough with a little lean and one foot or both feet just not flat. I also don’t really care for all the extras the RS come with the only one I really like would be it comes with the nicer dash.

I’m wondering if there would be any drawbacks of going with the R LRH to get the one with less miles? Does the LRH version lose and of the handling or hurt the bike in any other ways? Or would it make more sense to get the “better” one and get the RS for just a few bucks more and not worry about the miles?

Thanks for any input on the matter.

motorcycles,"Hi folks. I've been riding a while now and this dilemma has me stumped. Lookin for a bit of advice. I have a group of  friends who ride together on and off.

We're prudent(but still fun) riders who use hand signals, staggered formation, and don't hit felony-worthy speeds. We also like to have fun, so we are by no means slow. Lately, one of my buddies started dating someone. They want to come along with rides, but they don't ride a bike. Of course, we all offer either a) passenger seats b) spare gear c) beater bikes and parking lot sessions so they can be part of the group. The SO doesn't want that though! They want to DRIVE with us while we ride. Not just like meet us at the destination hangout/restaurant. I mean like full on caravan. I don't like it. I don't feel safe with a two ton weight traveling behind me and my friends trying to accelerate and stay with us, but I also don't like riding at 4-wheel speed so they can hang. If we wanted to go car-pace, we'd carpool or something. How do I go about working this situation without losing my friend or especially pissing of their new SO? I want to ride safely, swiftly, and freely. Also, my buddie's SO is pretty cool except for this driving along thing. Thoughts? Am I being selfish? Is there a compromise here somewhere I'm missing?

Unfortunately he had to sell his bike due to circumstances not long ago. Been having so much fun riding but getting a bit lonely riding alone.

I know it's not the 4 cylinder cbr250rr, but I've been having so much fun and learned a lot on this bike. Just recently changed the tyre with dunlop alpha 13, and noticed the change in grip immediately. I didn't think I would be able to tell the difference but turns out it's very noticeable.

I'm not a speedfreak, in fact I'm scared riding too fast. I chose the bike due to the styling. I would love to have a cruiser somewhere down the line because it cost an arm and a leg here. 

My next plan is to either wrap it with the rc213vs livery or to have it repainted in British racing green (I feel this color fits the bike well).

I also would like to take the bike on a longer trip, maybe an overnight trip so I'll be getting a tail bag for that.

Any tips for me to improve the bike?

I just finished a 5,000 mile road trip starting in Austin, TX and getting all the way up to Glacier National Park before turning around.  I have the summer off and the goal of the trip was to avoid the insane heat we are getting in Texas, and escape to cooler temperatures at elevation in the mountains.  

The V-Strom ran like a top, averaging around 50mpg fully loaded with camping gear.  I typically stayed with friends or family, but spent over 2 weeks of the trip tent camping at State Parks, National Parks, or boondocking.  I ate as much fresh food as I could from grocery store pickups, and had a Jetboil and skillet to make coffee, oats, fried foods, and dehydrated meals in a pinch.

I brought a Canon RP DSLR with a 24-105mm L lens, a 35mm prime, and my Pixel phone.  I took over 500+ photos and wrote in depth about the entire experience at my blog.  This is non-monetized and I prefer the long format of a blog for motorcycle touring:

With the 800GS money, you can buy a very very prime example of a used GS Dakar, equip and customise it, and cover its costs for a couple of years maybe.F650GS Dakar (Single Cyl.) vs F800GS (twin) - Should I consider doubling+ the budget?"

Many bikes, especially older, have an air filter located on the side of the bike under a fairing, and then this goes into a pipe that takes air into the carb etc etc. My question, has anyone ever heard or someone turning this style air intake into a ram air set up.

Most bikes a limiting factor is how fast you can get air into the thing, and these side set ups the engine is essentially ""sucking"" the air in, rather than the air naturally flowing into the engine.

I still consider myself a beginner rider but am perfectly at ease getting the bike to do what I need it to do, and during daylight hours I feel comfortable with pretty much any kind of street or highway riding or traffic.

Night time is a different story.

Something about the reduced visibility makes me really sort of tense up and it feels like the cars around me are closer than they may actually be. This causes me to be slightly more abrupt and jerky in my throttle and brake inputs, which puts me further on edge.

This happen to anyone else? Will it eventually pass?

So I called the dealership and had them come pick the bike up to take care of the tire. After getting the bike the dealership calls me up and tells me it's going to be $140 to find the problem with the tire. I tell them it's absurd to charge that much money to look at a tire. If it's not repairable then I just ate half the price of a tire for you to tell me it's no good. I asked him to give me a price on a new tire, Michelin power 5, same as what I have now. So they said they would call me back. They called me back 10 minutes later and said there's some sort of problem with the balancing machine and they don't know if it's going to take 30 or 40 gram weights for example because the machines messed up but it would still be $140 to look at it. I asked them the price of the new tire and they told me it would be $374 for the tire, an hour of Labor to install it and tax. This comes out to $545 for one rear tire. That tire is about a year old with 1100 miles. I bought the front and rear from them and a new chain they charged me $600.

(Not looking for validation),"I have taken the motorcycle basic riders course to get my endorsement. Overall I felt very comfortable throughout the course and really just had fun the whole time. Since I’ve driven manual cars before, the idea of friction zone and shifting gears comes naturally. I obviously have MUCH to learn. 
HOWEVER, after much research, and consideration I’ve decided that I’ll take the risk of getting a little more power than my skills could probably handle with the the street triple. I’ve chosen a naked bike to commute the majority of my work days and to ride around the weekends. I’m thinking I’ll be more reserved on the road and push it on the track where it’s safer to do so. I’m at peace with the fact that I will drop it. Just hopefully on the track only.

motorcycles,"hello so I own a FZ07.
I will admit I have been neglecting maintenance due to tight finances however it may bite me in the ass in the future.

There is noticeable rust on the bike disc brakes. Some nuts. And the chain is rusty. Have not lubed or cleaned in months.

Does anyone have a rust 101 to help combat all these problems? Maybe YouTube video Goto’s


Notes: I have been parking my bike outside near a patch of brown dirt patch which probably has been a bad idea since dirt holds moisture and can cause rust. Also outside in the rain and sun for couple months now. Not good. I have now moved the bike to a green grassy patch. Still outside since no garage.

motorcycles,"Hello guys,

I would like to hear some advice on where to look for a source of the noise. I know it could be a thousand different things, but what in Your opinion is the most probable culprit of a grinding noise only when accelerating?

I have Kawasaki ER-6N 2012 - it has 26 000km mileage

It sounds metalish, I don't want to even say from a friction of metal to metal but it might be, probably is.

It's most hearable while in higher than second gear, in 1st and 2nd its almost unnoticeable, partially due to exhaust sound. When I detach the drive, the motorcycle shows no noise at all, also revving the engine sounds perfectly fine. When I release the clutch the revs are coming back to match with no strange noises, but as soon as I accelerate in 3rd gear the metalish noise comes back.

I've checked all I could for now, before I'll have a chance to visit a mechanic. I've cleaned the chain thoroughly and lubed it. As I have this bike for not that long, I was cleaning the front sprocket for the first time and there was a lot of filth resembling 'poppy seed cake' lol. Then I've checked the ball bearings of the rear wheel by twisting the wheel - it showed no play at all. I couldn't check the front ball bearing however in my current conditions.

I've read the grinding noise could be coming from the ball bearings in the wheels, but it would make noise even while pulling the clutch in and not accelerating, tho accelerating allegedly exacerbates the symptoms of shot ball bearings. I've checked the rear wheel which shows no signs of ware.

What I noticed however, while rotating the rear wheel freely, it made this grind noise, it was coming from the rear brake pads touching the disc. I removed the disc brake and the grind noise was gone, I pulled the cylinders back with a screwdriver and reinstalled the brake again, after pumping the foot pedal it came back again to this state of slightly touching the disc brake and making a noise while the wheel is rotating - is this normal??. The brake pads are barely worn out and they weren't changed in forever, they are not impairing the wheel motion.

Could the chain make a grinding noise under stress when accelerating? It showed some slack but nothing too crazy, I will fix that in the future but does loose chain make a grinding noise on acceleration?

Its probably something in the clutch, or maybe the front ball bearing? I apologize for this guessing game from me but maybe there is a common thing related to this symptoms that You know of. It will help me get prepared for the visit with the mechanic.

Anyway, thanks in advance.",Grinding noise only when accelerating.,"Hello guys,

Finally got my bike put back together and almost rideable, just trying to knock out the rest of the kinks. Things I have done (and triple-checked before buttoning up): valve clearance, carb cleaning and rebuilding, changing pilot jets from 35 to 38 to help lean running, vacuum leaks, ignition timing is within factory settings, fuel screws at 3.5 turns (anything below 3 and bike is too lean), replaced OEM paper air filter with foam filter, same shape. Changed oil and oil filter.

Getting a loud BANG of backfire sometimes with some flame, only when I quickly blip the throttle up past 4000 rpm and let go. It is an aftermarket exhaust, GPR exhaust no baffle. Doesn’t happen below 4000 rpm. If I hold say 5000 rpm then let go it doesn’t backfire. Carbs synced after “final” adjustments.

Also note: I have ran the bike with the size 35 jets and didn’t notice any backfire. The ignition timing was also set SLIGHTLY later from where it is now, set via the throttle sensor. Which leads me to believe it’s a timing thing or a fuel thing. But I’ve messed with those fuel screws forever and get the same results.

Now my problem is, I’m struggling to confidently find a radiator guard that is not cheaply made and will definitely fit. Same issue with the cowl cover, I have the Red model and I’m worried whatever one I buy will be slight mis coloured or something. 

Regarding pillion peg removal, the Coffman exhaust doesn’t require an exhaust hanger at all, so I’m looking for ‘blanking plates’. I’ve previously R&amp;G no issue, and may do so again but I’m not sure if I can buy two of the same ones from the non-exhaust side and put one on either side.

Either way, I imagine it doesn’t know when a less efficient fuel is in use.

motorcycles,"Been riding my 2nd Gen Wee to work every day, rain or shine, since April, when the gas prices really skyrocketed. Put about 1200 miles on it, putting the odometer at roughly 12000. At 50 mpg vs. 18 in my truck, I was feeling like a financial boss.

Last week I parked as usual and a co-worker said I left the headlights on. WTF, says I. I check and sure enough they're on - and so is the ignition. I have the key in my hand!

I hop on and it starts right up WITHOUT THE KEY - but then the ignition switch won't kill the motor. I kill it with the switch, and then nothing - no lights, dash, anything, regardless of the key position.

Found the main 30A fuse blown. Swapped it, and immediately blew it as well. So it was off to the shop for repair.

Shop told me today that they found damaged wiring under the seat. After repairing that, they thought it was fixed, but a test ride blew the main fuse again. So it's the ignition.

Total bill's just shy of a grand, and that does NOT include rekeying the gas cap/seat. I told them to skip that. For $600 additional dollars, I'll just roll with two keys from now on.

Mostly I just wanted to vent - every dime I saved on gas over the summer, and then some, has gone into repairs. 

But I'll ask - anyone else had ignition troubles with the Wee? Am I getting bent over by the shop? And are their any disadvantages aside from the obvious of having two keys instead of one-for-all? Anything I can do to prevent a repeat problem? I do leave the bike out in the rain when I'm at work, but the bike should hold up to that, right? I'm thinking of putting a sink stopper over the keyhole from now on, though I have no idea if water in the ignition was the problem. Thanks y'all.",2nd Gen Wee - ignition replacement negates all my gas money savings :(,"Been riding my 2nd Gen Wee to work every day, rain or shine, since April, when the gas prices really skyrocketed.

motorcycles,"Hi all,

New rider - 2.5months. Everyday when I go for a ride I find an empty lot and practice drills esp slow speed. For the last 3 days I have spent about 3-4h on deadstop uturns from the left and right as well as figure 8's. The goal is to be within two parking spaces and make it as tight as possible. I am having success however when I do the exercises the next day sometimes I don't do as well as the day before until some time has passed even with more exp under my belt day after day.

It is kind of worrying as I feel that I should be getting better to the point that it becomes as easy as drinking water. So I was curious, how long does one need until they get better with drills? I know years is an easy answer but I am assuming 4h is not enough however how long is too long until you need to see consistency in drills.

Also, right now I have to put a foot down whenever the bike is going to slow to avoid falling, the bike is an R3 so it weighs about 350lbs. How easy is it to put a foot down with a bigger bike? Also worried that I will drop it more often as I practice and yes I would put frame sliders on a new bike like I have on my current.

motorcycles,"So, I tried to change the brake fluid on my 2016 Kawasaki er6-f ABS today, and somehow I think I managed to get air in the ABS module. 

Changing the fluid on the front brakes went smoothly, but when I bleed the rear one I think I was either too late with topping of the fluid or messing up with depressing the pedal. Either way (I think) there is air in the ABS module or the break line. Tried to bleed it like you normally would be but neither air or brake fluid squirted out the bleed nipple. When I tried to ride it I could stand on the pedal and yet there was no indication of the bike even having a rear brake.

Here's why I'm asking: a friend of mine is considering a Royal Enfield as a starter bike. One rider friend told **him that a recent RE is a fine choice.** Meanwhile, I suggested he stay with a big four Japanese manufacturer, and that new or used, a Japanese bike is the better way to go.

Highway 1 was amazing to ride. We found a cutty little beach spot to sneak the bikes into and camp at. When we rolled in to town for coffee we encountered lots of other riders who naturally shared the enthusiasm and wanted to know about our trip. Motorcyclists in real life are friendlier than on the internet ;)  
 

On the last leg of the trip, just three miles from home, I felt my rear go flat. I’d picked up a screw! Now I’ve had a real adventure!  
 

Motorcycles rule, folks. Can’t be happier with my choice to finally get one and fulfill those dreams.

motorcycles,"Hey everyone! So, I did a dumb this weekend and forgot to take off the lock I have on my front wheel. Long story short, I busted a couple spokes right at the rim, shearing off the nipple itself. A couple questions at this point:  
1- How serious is it? Obviously I want to address it sooner than later, but how immediate of an issue is it?  
2- One of the shops I contacted basically said I needed to wait until winter, and they wont guarantee the work. Is it really that labor intensive?  
3- Am I possibly better off just buying a decent used rim and swapping them out?

Gday folks. I'm a big dude with a pretty small bike - a Yamaha Virago 250 (2016) that I ride about 20% of the time, mostly just around the city when it's nice out. I'm mostly happy with the bike - a bit more oomph on the motorway would be nice, but I'm not on it often. The one big problem I have is that the mirrors aren't wide enough; my shoulders block about half the view, and I can't see behind me unless I lean my body to the opposite side, which means I end up taking more time checking and have my eyes off the road in front of me about twice as long as I'd like. I don't have any experience modding bikes, so other than some googling, I don't know what the options are for making my mirrors wider are.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",Wide shouldered dude looking for advice on mirrors.,"TL;DR: What aftermarket options are there for widening out my mirrors to see past my shoulders without having to move my body out of the way?

motorcycles,"Pretty sure I'm in shock. Fingers have got that magic tingle and I am think fast but talking slowly. Also very cold for some reason.

I just got home from my afternoon work commute, and had a fat fucking cunt (i think it was a fat fucking cunt. it could have been a dugong with the amount of pale flesh on display) in a cock-extension 4WD swerve in front of me while I was lane-splitting at a set of traffic lights. You've all probably seen one like it. The ""my personality is 4WDing"". Big lift kit. Chrome side steps. Snorkel. UHF and Caterpillar mudflaps.

For clarity, it is entirely legal where I am to lane-split on a motorcycle provided it is safe to do so (e.g. not where there are large/heavy vehicles in the queue at the lights etc).

There was plenty of room for me, and I was doing about 30km/h (\~19mph) with a decent buffer on either side of my bars. Suddenly, a big 4WD on my right shoots out in front of me, his front left wheel crossed into the left lane. The front of the 4WD was maybe 3 inches from the car on my left. 

I locked up hard on the rear brake and about 70% on the front, ABS kicked in and thankfully the back end stayed tidy enough that I didn't hit anything and while I layed the bike down, it was after I stopped. I have frame sliders that limited the damage mostly to a broken mirror. Might need to replace my topbox.

The 4WD was second from the front of the queue, so by the time I collected myself, got back on my feet and the bike upright, he had gone and I couldn't catch him. Thankfully there was not one but two good samaritans that got out and gave me their details. I also got most of it on my cam, so I'll be going to the police when my hands stop shaking. He yelled some abuse as he drove off too.

The thing that really gets me is that the 4WD lift kit put the side steps at or above chest height if I had gone into a slide and gone into/under him. Why the fuck would anyone intentionally do that?

Sorry about the rant, but I came here to ask 2 things:

1. How good is ABS? I will never own a bike without it.
2. Have you guys encountered people similar to this? I've been riding a while (somewhere around 17 years) and I swear I get guys like this maybe once or twice a year. Never this bad, though. Usually just brake checking hard (even though I buffer 2 to 3 car lengths most times) and shit like that.

motorcycles,"2 months ago I bought a new to me bike, a 2016 GSR750, it came with a tail tidy and Givi top box mount, but not the box.

I ride to work, whether it's raining or not and I've heard that tail tidies aren't a good idea in the rain, that water sprays up your back.
I'm currently working from home, so I haven't had the chance to experience this yet.


I've been wondering something, but it's not the easiest thing to search for, will my top box mount actually work as a kind of fender and protect my back?
It sticks out quite a bit and it's wide. I was wondering if anyone else happens to have a tail tidy and a top box and if they get a wet/dirty back from the spray off the tyre.

I could put some Perspex under the mount to cover the small gaps and to extend slightly closer to the rear seat.

Ultimately I'll find out one day, but I'd really like to know in advance because I'd also like to remove the top box mount, but if it'll keep me dry, I'll keep it on.

Hey All,  


I am starting to purchase gear in anticipation of purchasing my first street bike (Ninja 400). I have been my usual self that likes to obsessively research every purchase I make and ensure I am getting the most for my spend. From Fortnine videos, to reddit, to forums, I landed upon FIM certification being the highest regarded helmet safety standard, and thus what I set my eyes on. I am currently looking at the HJC RPHA 1N. Yes, it is more expensive than many options, but paying for safety is not something I am opposed to.  


My question comes from some of the reviews I have seen which mention that the helmet is heavier than other options, and the reviewer typically justifies it with ""but its a race helmet, and you only race for so long."" While I may eventually want to try a track day, it certainly isn't why I am buying the helmet, nor will I ever really want to actively race. So my usage would be almost exclusively for street use. The helmet weights 3.33lbs. Are there any of you that ride with this helmet, or a similar race orientated/perhaps heavier helmet for street use for extended periods of time? What has been your experience of it? I am pretty strongly built guy, I honestly can't see 3.33lbs being a deal breaker for me, but being inexperienced I wanted to see the opinion of some others.   


This thread isn't intended for helping me find a helmet or asking for purchase advice. I am genuinely interested in the experiences you may have with this or similar weighted helmets.

Without a ride anymore, my friend offered to give me a lift. It just so happens my friend is female (she's awesome).

motorcycles,"I recently got myself a bike about 6 months ago and have been enjoying it to the fullest. A lot of people within my friend group have been talking about getting bikes ever since, and one actually started taking the steps to get licensed to ride. 

I was so unbelievably excited for him; looking at bikes and sending him gear and useful things to know. He just took the first day of the msf today and has pretty much completely given up after getting on a bike for the first time.

Within the first few hours he dropped 2 bikes, one got the clutch lever snapped off, scraped tf out of his knee and the entire time could barely make it past 10 mph w/o stalling. From what I understand he just can't get the concept of the clutch and friction zone, I went over a lot of it with him before he took the course but he just can't seem to get it right. He ended up leaving early and doesn't seem to want to go back and try again.

He is blaming his height and weight and has been saying he's just too small to ride, that the bikes are too heavy etc etc. He is 5'6 130 and that seems completely fine and I've seen much smaller riders on much bigger bikes driving around. Apparently he is super embarrassed to have dropped the bikes because nobody else did, but then I found out that his entire class was full of experience dirt bike / out of state riders getting refreshers. I tried to explain to him that the class is supposed to be a safe place where you can drop the bike and learn, but he seems too demoralized to care.

He claims that the headlights, stator cap, battery and chain needs to be replaced. As well as some work needs to be done on the wiring harness.  I wrench in my free time on my truck and my current bike so I'm sure that I can do most of the work.

Off the top of my head estimated prices for parts and whatnot would be: 
$300 for the fairings
$100 ish for the lights
$100 ish for the stator cap
$300 for the tires
$150 for the chain
??? - Shop to look it over and give it the ok

motorcycles,"Today, while riding in on my Honda CTX700 with a large windscreen (metric cruiser) it started to rain very lightly as I was going straight on the freeway.

The wind between my chest / helmet and windscreen makes a circular vortex; this caused the rain drops that fell into the area to slow down to a stop and then slowly rotate in mid air like a scene from The Matrix. 

The circle moved up and toward the front of the bike to fall and come back and move up again. 

This completely distracted my eyes and felt like an eternity and it lasted for almost a mile until I had to change lanes which disrupted the air and everything fell at the same time.

It was completely surreal and I could completely understand some ancient person would see this phenomenon as a ""Sign from God.""

I would never have experienced this if I didn't choose to ride a motorcycle in the rain.

Perfect 5/7   
Would Ride Again",Has this situation happened to anyone else? I can't be the only one.,"Today, while riding in on my Honda CTX700 with a large windscreen (metric cruiser) it started to rain very lightly as I was going straight on the freeway.

The wind between my chest / helmet and windscreen makes a circular vortex; this caused the rain drops that fell into the area to slow down to a stop and then slowly rotate in mid air like a scene from The Matrix. 

The circle moved up and toward the front of the bike to fall and come back and move up again. 

This completely distracted my eyes and felt like an eternity and it lasted for almost a mile until I had to change lanes which disrupted the air and everything fell at the same time.

It was completely surreal and I could completely understand some ancient person would see this phenomenon as a ""Sign from God.""

I would never have experienced this if I didn't choose to ride a motorcycle in the rain.

Over the years I've always just used dirt bike gloves. They have no real padding or anything. To be honest they might turn to shreds if I were to go down. I'm trying to be a little more serious about protection. Have yet to have an accident (knock on wood) but would like to be as safe as possible if it were to happen.

Trying to wear these gloves makes it so hard for me to feel the throttle and clutch. It's kind of awkward. Pretty sure they fit fine. Fingertips touch the end on my index and middle finger but not too much to where it feels tight. Ring finger and pinky have very very slight room (I have weird fingers lol) but not too much room and doesn't seem like that'd be a problem. I actually put them in my backpack on my way home today because I felt less safe with them on. Is this just something I'll have to get used to?",Gloves making it hard to feel the controls.

I know that right tyre pressure is very crucial for optimum handling. I also know that pressure increases with an increase in temperature of the tyre. the pressure difference from default during street riding might be insignificant but that minute difference can have a major impact on track.

1) Does the manufacturer factor in the temperature increase from cold tyres to hot tires, so does this mean they knowingly recommend low tyre pressure so once the tyre gets warm the tyre pressure would be ideal for handling?

2) If the above case is true then does this mean filling tyre with nitrogen has an adverse affect as the increase in tyre pressure of a nitrogen filled tyre would be less than an air filled tyre, once the tyre gets warm?",How do motorcycle manufacturers set default tyre pressure?,"Like is it based on the physical aspects of a bike weight, shape, etc.

I went riding with a guy the other day, and afterwards he checked his bike(s1000rr) and it said his max angle for the ride was 40 degrees(assuming mine was roughly the same).  I never scraped any parts of my bike or anything, so can I feel safe leaning it more, and if so am I getting to “hang off the bike” levels?At what lean angle does body position become important?"
motorcycles,"I live in San Jose CA, and I've wanted to do a ride along the coast for some time now, my only worry is the fuel mileage.
I've seen various articles online talking about how a lot of gas stations on 1 can close early, and on all three of my bikes(grom, fz07, fz09) I usually get around 100 miles of range on their tanks.
I'm curious on whether it would be necessary to bring extra fuel if I want to do the trip. I've been up and down hwy 1 between Carmel and SF, and I haven't had any gas station worries around there, would the rest of the road down to LA/San Diego still be like that?

motorcycles,"Heya, first post here and fairly new rider. I just got home from a stupid accident in which I jammed by front brake because an animal popped out in front (I know, I should have just hit the animal. It was a squirrel. I love animals but this was unforgivably idiotic). Despite having taken a motorcycle course, my instant reaction was to squeeze the front brake WAY too hard, and as a result the bike turned sideways and flipped forward, throwing me out in front. Thankfully was only going about 50kph and no cars nearby to hit me. 

Was able to jump immediately and move the bike off the road (though it's a bit banged up and won't start, but that's another issue), and I think my only injuries are a scraped knee and possibly a mild wrist sprain, so I'm feeling extremely fortunate. 

Once I get my bike operational, I want to be able to avoid having such a stupid mishap ever again. Does anyone have any similar experience and can offer advice on how they trained themselves out of that deadly gut-reaction brake squeeze? I so often try to tell myself ""soft, slow hands"" while braking, but in the moment my body took over to terrible results.

motorcycles,"My sincere thanks to you all for reading this post. 

I'm completely blind in my right eye and have 20/30 vision (with a contact lens) in my left eye. I have loved motorcycles my entire life, and was devastated when I became blind as a teenager after several eye surgeries. Initially, I thought my blindness would be temporary, so I read all the handbooks and watched all the YouTube videos I could because I needed some form of motivation to keep on going.

When my surgeon told me it would be permanent, I was crushed. The only thing I looked forward to as an adult was getting my own motorcycle; no one around me understood why I was so depressed.

Now that I'm 20 and about to turn 21, I've finally gotten the courage and funds to take the Motorcycle Safety Course. Everyone in my family has been discouraging me because I could get myself hurt. While I really do understand their concern, it gets tiring after hearing the 20th person tell you what you can't do without at least letting you try. 

I've brought it up briefly with my doctor, and she's one of the few so far that believes I can do it. I trust her judgement, but my family doesn't believe that I can, and their constant comments make me doubt myself.

Furthermore, I've already gone out to a gear shop to try on helmets, and ended up leaving with an HJC i90 and an excellent pair of Alpinestars gloves. The visibility in that helmet was better than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise since I thought my peripheral vision would be compromised. 

So, with this in mind, is it a good idea for me to take the Motorcycle Safety Course?",Is it a good idea to ride a motorcycle while half-blind?,"My sincere thanks to you all for reading this post.

motorcycles,"(Mods, I saw rule 2 I felt this was a broad enough request to warrant a post, 🙏 not trying to be ignorant)

Hey all, hoping to get some of your opinions on gear a beginner should be looking at!

I’m pretty sold on getting a vstrom 650, it calls to me, and I’m realizing there is a lot more to things than just financing. My dad is a huge motorcycle junkie (moto x and gp) used to be a mechanic/salesman and has owned quite a few, so I’m certain he’ll influence a lot of things when I get a chance to go shopping with him. That’s a few months out more than likely though, and I wouldn’t mind some additional bias to balance out suggestions.

I’m mainly wanting to ride as a commuter, with some smooth dirt trails near where I live occasionally, and I have always wanted to ride again but I’ve always been a little timid around it. My dad bought me a mini dirtbike when I was really young and I was way into it, I just missed the opportunity to get into riding with my dad as a teen cause life got in the way. While I still can, I want to get into it, yknow? 

So! Feel free to go overboard, what are your tips/suggestions for a new rider and what kind of gear should I be putting in my shopping list? I want to go from newbie to competent with as little growing pains as possible, barring learning to ride on the road. 

Also, for the tall folks out there, I’m 6’2” with my gamer posture, if you have any tall person specifics to share, please hit me with it! I realize just from cursory google foo that there are a lot of height-specific quirks when it comes to the bikes themselves, so I imagine the same could apply to all aspects.

Thanks so much in advance! It means a lot!

motorcycles,"It was cloudy with dry road conditions. There had been no cars in front of me for at least 2-3 minutes. I was going around a left hand bend at 50mph – speed limit of the particular section of the road I was on. This bend had very high hedges / bushes on the left side. I was in the number 3 position so I could see as far ahead as I could. I then saw stationary traffic in front of me so I immediately emergency braked – the car in front did not have its hazard lights on. I realized I would not be able to stop in time and would rear end the car positioned last in the line of the stationary traffic so I moved slightly across into the opposing lane whilst slowing down (emergency braking). It was at this point I saw a car emerge from the opposing lane so I felt I had no choice but to “go for the cap” to minimise damage and casualties. I thus collided with the front right headlight area of the vehicle – which was pretty much stationary as the driver saw me coming and also braked. 

The driver of the other vehicle and its passengers were thankfully uninjured. 

Some drivers in the opposing lane came up and told me the reason there was a line of stationary traffic around a bend was because a man with a trailer had misjudged a turn ahead and had to get out of their vehicle to maneuver their trailer to make it round the bend. 

I could not see more than 6-7 car lengths in front of me whilst going around the bend. I was riding a Yamaha YZF-R125 ABS. Bike is pretty much toast now I think - at least all of the front end is.

motorcycles,"Hi all. I plan on taking a CMSP and MSF course in my area (L A suburbs) sometime within a year. I will purchase the needed gear and will do my DD on what's safe gear.

Following that, I will continue to save to purchase a new 2022 Grom. I probably won't be able to afford until spring, or summer next year. 

The reason I'm going with new is because the last car and the car I have right now are from the early 2000s, and riddled with problems; fixing them costs more than they're worth, and I really don't want to deal with old crap anymore. 

I will watch YouTube videos and practice in parking lots until I'm comfortable on the streets. I won't be taking the highway. Once I'm comfortable, I will get rid of the car I have now.

Despite the various posts that say motorcycles are more expensive to own, I think it still will be cheaper for the area I'm living in and with the cars I can afford. 

I'm okay with 124cc to learn and to fatefully drop while learning.

I currently drive for food delivery after office work and plan on continuing to do so, weather permitting, which it always does.

I believe my costs to be: 

* **$4500 + tax** - $3599 **Grom ABS** + $200 **destination charge** + $100 **freight surcharge** + $600 **dealership fees** (?). I'm going to purchase from a dealership that powersports.honda.com shows near me. Will they send it to my address?

* **$700 - CMSP and MSF courses total**. I would like to take both because dying isn't something I'm interested in yet.

* ~**$600-800 - helmet, gloves, jacket, boots, food delivery accessories, motorcycle kneepads** (I work in an office, jeans not permitted but chinos are).

* **$400 - tools**. I'm not a handy man by trade but I enjoy learning and working on my own things. I'll need to get a mat or cardboard for the ground though because I rent.

* **~$200-300, bi-annually - tires**, replaced with service, unless I plan to do them myself down the line.

* **~$300-500, annually - insurance**. What kind of coverage should I be looking to get?

* **~$300-600, annually - mods**. Because everyone says it will happen.

* **$200, annually - gas** (I'm averaging $60-80 weekly)

* **$300, annually - filters and uhhh stuff**

* **15 hours, monthly** - maintenance

Total first year cost: **$8800**

Why I want a motorcycle: looks fun. Wrenching looks fun, too, once I git gud at it with quality tools.

I live to work (two jobs, work everyday) because I no longer enjoy free time after I got sober. I want to spend less on gas and insurance, which could easily pay for a Grom after 1.5 years.

^(Also, are there classes I can take at a community college on the weekends/nights to learn working on a motorcycle?)I want a sexy little Grom. I never rode before. I need advice and would like someone to read over my game plan."

motorcycles,"Pretty much as it says in the title. I've had probably the worst year I could ever wish on my worst enemy. 

Went down to the pub to celebrate the fact that it's been a good couple months anniversary since I tried committing the  ""s word"" (I don't want to trigger anyone) and enjoy a bit of food and a coke.

Security from the pub next door rush in to ask who's bike is outside as it's been kicked over. I follow on to see what's the damage and the bike seems okay. I see the two cunts amped up on god knows what in the corner and think that's the end of it. The bouncer says he will keep an eye on it while I rush in and get my stuff. 

I come back out and the fucking thing is kicked over again but they've gone and done a runner. 

Fortunately I've got the registration number and details of the car that they ran off in, I know what the guys look like and were passed on pictures of them too by the bouncers. 

I'm hoping that CCTV caught something because a probation office and two pubs literally line the street.

Visually aside from a cracked mirror and a slightly askew clutch lever the bike seems okay visually but in any gear, it revs like fuck and I cannot get past 20 ISH mph without it sounding like a bag of bolts being shook about. 

I don't even feel angry at this point but I'm just so fucking taken aback and heartbroken. I literally just got the thing up and running again, started getting myself straight and now I find myself with no transport to get to work and therapy and no money to make the repair 🙂

I don't know what the problem is or whether it's even worth getting claiming on insurance. My excess is £600 and I already bought as a Category N.

So far, I've changed the oil, spark plugs, and used the highest quality 98/100 octane fuel (Europe), but the noise persists.

I took it to the shop and they said that they couldn't find the source of the noise, so I am relying on the community to help me.

motorcycles,"Life isn’t fair, suck it up, hang in there and ride it out, screw it and just do it? Decisions, decisions…..

Anyways, Covid allowed us a lot of time to think and contemplate life. From our careers and trips we’d like to take one day, to goals we’d like to achieve eventually. 

I feel stuck at my current job. College degree, pay sucks, cost of living in my area is dumb. I live in one of the best motorcycling and outdoor recreation destinations in the country. That’s probably what has kept me here this long. Why not make a change?

A lot of riders have dreams of going on epic journeys. I’m one of them. Recently bought a new set of wheels that I absolutely adore. It’s slow and shouldn’t be as fun as it is. This has been part of the inspiration for this potential journey. 

I want to quit my current job without a plan for what’s next. I’ve been working to save up money for a down payment on a house, but refer to absurd cost of living comment from above. 

The idea is to pack up the bike next spring and head out without a firm route in place. A 4 corners ride with Alaska and Nova Scotia thrown in there sounds like fun. 16,000 miles, broken into 150-200 mile days, 45-50mph, 5-6 months, guessing it’ll cost 8-10k. That seems to be enough time to properly clear my head. When/if I decide to stop riding, figure out a career move next fall. 

That’s the idea. Only got one life. Wait until I’m older to accomplish it, or jump ship and just send it? Can always make more money. Just don’t wanna have any regrets down the line.

Thanks for the advice.",Talk me out of a (possibly?) poor life decision.,"Life isn’t fair, suck it up, hang in there and ride it out, screw it and just do it? Decisions, decisions…..

Anyways, Covid allowed us a lot of time to think and contemplate life. From our careers and trips we’d like to take one day, to goals we’d like to achieve eventually. 

I feel stuck at my current job. College degree, pay sucks, cost of living in my area is dumb. I live in one of the best motorcycling and outdoor recreation destinations in the country. That’s probably what has kept me here this long. Why not make a change?

A lot of riders have dreams of going on epic journeys. I’m one of them. Recently bought a new set of wheels that I absolutely adore. It’s slow and shouldn’t be as fun as it is. This has been part of the inspiration for this potential journey. 

I want to quit my current job without a plan for what’s next. I’ve been working to save up money for a down payment on a house, but refer to absurd cost of living comment from above.

motorcycles,"I never see anyone recommend hydrocolloid bandages for road rash on here. It’s like a miracle. I’ve never used it for road rash but rather tree rash from mtb’ing. It heals so much faster with less scarring , and the best part is a lot less pain because your nerves are basically in a nice warm bath of your own healing fluids. Is there a reason for that? Or do people just not know about it. Last year i skinned my forearm down to the fat layer in some places, it healed in about 10 days and no dry itchy scabs or exposed wounds.

motorcycles,"Hi there reddit,

Some time ago, before the Husqvarna 901 was released, there was speculation about the possible arrival of a Norden 401 and a 501, even official documents were leaked confirming it.

Still, Husqvarna has not made any statement and we have not seen any test images of these models.

I understand that for the 501 they will wait for the KTM 490 to come out, but I do not understand why they have not released a Norden 401 yet, since the KTM 390 engine has been on the market for some time and they have taken advantage of it with the Svartpilen and the Vitpilen.

Has more information come out?  Do you think the Husqvarna 401 could be a reality by 2023?

Or has the model been cancelled and will they wait directly for the 501?

I'm about to get my license soon and I don't know whether to wait for EICMA to see if they announce anything or assume that the Norden 401 will not be released by 2023, or even ever..

motorcycles,"Old Yamma twin. Oil and filter change as usual. Had been a few years since I looked at the oil screen thats at the bottom of the oil pan (slightly below drain bolt. Held on by 6 tiny 8mm bolts and a gasket. In past it had some small metal flakes so wanted to give it a look. Looked good

Went to reattach with torque wrench set to 10 ft-lbs. Torque wrench worked fine for drain bolt and filter bolt. Something went wrong at such a low setting. I kept spinning it and was surprised it hadn't clicked off. I kept spinning (gasp), despite thinking something was off. 

Now I have half a bolt that dropped out, half stuck way in there. Naturally it stripped the threads in that area. So... I assume best practice would be to remove the half a bolt somehow (seems too deep / small for EZ out) and retap it? Would it be terribly ill-advised to leave it and see if it just holds a seal assuming I don't need to check that screen anytime soon and know I need to keep an eye on it/oil level? 

TLDR:  Can i leave stripped half bolt in bottom of pan? It's one of 6 bolts holding on a screen housing. I added couple hundred CC of oil last night to see if it drips (not under load). Can't post pics here, so:

motorcycles,"Hi all,

A goal of mine is to learn to drive a manual car - never drove one before although I know how the mechanics works. I got my moto (manual of course) 2 months ago and I have experience now with clutch, blipping, rev matching, etc. Most people learn a manual car before a bike but in my case it will be vice versa.

I am not sure which is harder to learn, a moto or a manual car but it seems a manual car might be trickier when I think about things like heel-toe and the fact that the gear changes are down in different ways/patterns rather than a click-up or down with a bike. Also the fact that you can change gears without a sequence (like go from 1 to 3 or higher) is different too.

Therefore, for you guys out there that drive manual - which one did you find harder? Esp looking for input from those that learned a moto before a manual car. Wondering what things I should be aware of. I plan on starting soon but because I may pay for lessons (don't know anyone with a manual car) I would like to limit the amount of time I spend with an instructor.

I'm pretty sure the gas has evaporated and the motor oil has turned to jelly and the battery has corroded.

I bought my own motorcycle last year and needed a place to store it, and lo and behold, storing it in my garage made perfect sense.  But, I didn't have space for two bikes.  So I walked his bike to my backyard (he did not ever give me the keys and nor did I ask for them initially) and parked my own bike in my garage.

So now his bike has been sitting in my backyard for a year. And he realized that about a month ago, and he wasn't happy because now the bike is exposed to the elements and I guess a pigeon took a shit on it?

He says he's trying to sell it, but the fact that I left it in the backyard for months is making it very difficult to sell and he'd like me to put it back in my garage.  I said no, I don't have the space for it in the garage and that he should go and get a cover for it.

I guess he got annoyed with me and hasn't really spoken to me in a month whereas we used to chat nearly everyday before that.  I assume there's other reasons that are annoying him as well about some stuff that happened a few weeks back, but I'm not really thinking about it too much cause I'm assuming he'll come around?  He's a decent guy but he seems to have different priorities in life now.

In any case, I now have a rusted out cruiser sitting in my backyard that I have no idea what to do with.  I don't own it, otherwise I'd sell it for parts or scraps myself ages ago.  I'm not a wrencher so I have no interest in trying to fix it.  He doesn't want to sell it for parts or scrap and he believes he'll get more money than he paid for it (it is twenty years old and I think he's the third owner since 2015...?) so he wants to leave it here since his current apartment is the same place that won't allow him to park the bike there.

Any suggestions?",My cousin has left his motorcycle in my garage for five years. Wtf do I do with it?,"In 2017, he wasn't able to afford insurance to ride it and the owner of the apartment that he lived at wouldn't let him park his bike there.

motorcycles,"So today I had my very first lesson on a motorcycle and I just want to share in my excitement! I had no prior experience with anything like it besides my bicycle... So after getting geared up we drove to an industrial area with wide open roads and little traffic. Here we did a small walk around the bike and got explained the basic controls. I sat on the bike and me being 5""4' made it just so that I could tiptoe the (already lowered) bike. The weight of the bike was something I quickly got used to however.

First task was to get a feeling for the clutch, letting it out, getting both feet on the pegs, then braking and coming to a standstill. Excited with a healthy amount of nervousness I felt tense which made me feel a bit unstable. After getting more used to the clutch and throttle I quickly gained more confidence that I wouldn't just fall over. 

Next exercise was shifting and taking turns. With my instructor as my pillion and my lack of height, (read: could about just reach the ground) confidence didn't come naturally, but I soon noticed it barely mattered. Shifting was easy and cornering was like second nature. The biggest challenge to overcome was being too careful with the throttle. Inputs didn't feel smooth yet and accelerating would initiate with a kick instead of gradually picking up. This made me too aware, making me more tense. I quickly noticed how tense I was and relaxing my body helped a lot in becoming more smooth. Throttle control is still an issue tho... 

After a total of 30 minutes spent on the bike it was time to ride back. My first time on road with a bike and with my instructor still as my pillion. The first turn to get onto the road... sharp 90⁰ corner into oncoming traffic at 35mph. With so many things on my mind and still not totally comfortable with clutch and throttle controls I target fixated on the nice lush greenery on the other side of the road, taking the corner too wide and drove right into it... Nothing worrisome, all I had to do was stay calm and get back onto the asphalt.

 Afterwards we drove for about 10 minutes getting to experience roads I've driven for many years in a completely new way. Compared to driving a car, I felt so connected to the bike. You can feel what it's doing, the sounds, the vibrations, the heat of the engine - an incredible sensory experience. All I can think about is getting back on a bike (and that damn throttle control...).",I Had My Very First Experience On a Motorcycle Today!,"So today I had my very first lesson on a motorcycle and I just want to share in my excitement!

motorcycles,"I have a 1980 Suzuki TS125, it's been completely rebuilt from top to bottom by me and my dad (just amateur mechanics) and I'm actually quite proud of how far we've come. 
But the problem is it doesn't run completely smoothly, the attached video in the comments shows how it starts, the bike is basically cold, i only started it for a couple minutes to get it out of the garage, but the first start when it's completely cold actually needs a couple kicks at first to start up even with the choke on, it doesn't start first kick.
As you can hear, it doesn't have that iconic two stroke ringing at low rpm-s, and while riding it, it feels like it's missing a LOT of low-end torque. Once it gets into the higher rpm range it actually gets some power plus starts to sound like an actual two stroke with the rings and small pops.

motorcycles,"I met my girlfriend before I started riding. A while ago I had an accident (my own fault, I had zero sleep the day before bike training for my mod 1 due to getting bad news and ended up going into the back of another bike), my gf of a year spoke to me afterwards and asked me to stop riding. The thing is, she has anxiety and told me apparently every-time I went on the bike it would freak her out due to other people’s driving, but never said anything before because of how much I love it. I’ve never wanted to give it up but after what she told me I agreed to stop due to how she felt, but since then I’ve been having second thoughts. 

I’ve realised recently that for better or worse, my passion for bikes has become a part of me and to give it all up now over something that may or may not happen is a massive ask. Every time someone asks me about bikes and I say I’m done with it, my stomach churns and I feel sick saying that I’m over it. There will be a point where I will be too old to ride bikes, so while I’m young and able to I want to make the most of my passion. For all the bad experiences I’ve had with it, I’ve had great times too and I would have never been able to experience these had I never gotten into bikes. 

As for other peoples bad driving, they’ll be on the roads regardless if you drive, ride or walk. There’s always gonna be a risk with motorcycling, but you only get one life and I know I’ll regret stopping it now. For me, it’s a situation where I either suppress part of who I am to appease other people or stick up for myself and accept the consequences. I don’t think she’s wrong to ask me to stop, but I think she doesn’t quite realise how much it means to me. But at the same time, I do see where she is coming from. 

Ideally I want a compromise that’ll benefit both of us I.e. better gear, more training, airbag vest. I’ve tried to talk about this with her before but she didn’t really entertain it. I did suggest dirt bikes instead due to being off road and away from cars, she seemed to be okay with that but I realised where I am atm it wouldn’t be practical. 

Any advice you guys can give me would be great, my family see motorcycles as death traps so I don’t think they’ll see it from my perspective at all.","My gf wants me to stop riding, at first I said yes but now I don’t think I can","I met my girlfriend before I started riding.

now today theres this harley event in a nearby city so theres alot of harleys riding around everywhere. as i approach that long road, 3 bikers pull out in front of me from a side street (they didnt cut me off or anything) i believe they were hells angels.

motorcycles,"I see a lot of threads on forums and even on this subreddit about how motorcycles are chick magnets. I don't really think they are.

It might be the other way around even, I've been riding motorcycles for the past 5 years, I've got 3 of them and I'm kind of addicted to wrenching on them (mostly because they're POS).

My girlfriend and I were together for 3 years, and gradually she hated motorcycles with more and more passion. Shit did hit the fan when I started commuting on my bike to save money and time, but she hates cars too so it wouldn't have changed much.

To be honest I'm really sad I had to end a relationship mainly because I was ""too much"" into motorcycles according to her.

She wasn't like ""it's me or the bike"". But she was really agressive whenever motorcycles were passing by since I always took a look, or that I would talk about bikes with her biker friends (surprisingly she had a lot, her best friend was a biker and like 1/4th of all her friends).

Now I'm wondering if it's healthy, i think motorcycles are to be honest, it helps me in a lot of ways and I don't really think I'm insufferable about it but I wonder.

I decided to end the relationship when it became hell to just be around her since she hated it so much she told me I was an idiot for liking bikes and if I ever had an accident she wouldn't be there for me. It broke something in my heart

motorcycles,"I've had the same motorcycle for 6 years, a GSX650F. Drove it on and off over these 6 years.  Bought it used on Craigslist and it had scratches on the fairings but I didn't mind. It was my first bike so I figured I'd drop it one day anyway. Well after all these years I've never once dropped it or got into an accident. I'd say I'm not the best rider but I'm not bad. I saved and saved until I could finally afford a new bike.

Drove 4 hours away to pick up a brand new 2021 CBR650R I found. I've really wanted one for a couple years now but couldn't afford it. Signed the papers, shook the dealership salesmen hand, and took it on one loop around the parking lot just to get a feel for it. Pull around behind the trailer I'm about to put it on and honestly not sure if I somehow stalled it or hit the brake a little too hard as I finished up my turn but next thing you know it's dropping to the right and I'm trying to keep it from falling. Couldn't stop it. Laid it down gently and got it back up. Engine/crank cover is scratched up, one of the fairings and pinstripes is scratched up, the handlebar end cap is scratched up, and there's a scratch on my gas tank but not that's not too bad. Can possibly buff it out.

Damn talk about embarassing and demoralizing. The salesman wasn't outside but his coworker and other people were. Worst feeling in the world. I was so disappointed after being so excited to get it. I still like the bike but it's hard to not be upset about it. I think I'll be able to drive it fine as well. Just have to get used to it. It still runs and handles fine and everything, all the damage is cosmetic. I plan on finding replacement parts if I can and hoping I can make it look as if it never happened. Who knows maybe I'll drop it again (really hope not) but they're right when they say everyone drops a bike sometime. Just hate that it had to be my brand new bike that I only owned for 30 seconds before it happened.

motorcycles,"Was going about 45 mph on a 2 lane road and a deer jumped in front of me. I never even saw it until it landed 2 feet in front of me. I must have braked although I don't remember doing that, because there were 2 lines from my tires on the road. Then I hit right in the deer right in the middle of it and crashed, and luckily walked away with hardly a scratch, I have a small patch of road rash on my hip where my jacket rode up and that is it. I think I also got a slight concussion but even now, just a day later, I'm feeling better. My bike is rideable, but the handlebars are very bent and a few other parts are scratched up.

I must have braked although I don't remember doing that, because there were 2 lines from my tires on the road. Then I hit right in the deer right in the middle of it and crashed, and luckily walked away with hardly a scratch, I have a small patch of road rash on my hip where my jacket rode up and that is it. I think I also got a slight concussion but even now, just a day later, I'm feeling better. My bike is rideable, but the handlebars are very bent and a few other parts are scratched up.

At this point I have no idea what else to do, so any advice would be more than helpful! Plus any recommendations of other subreddits or forums where people may know would also be greatly appriciated. Thanks.Honda CBR125R Won't Start, Advice?"
motorcycles,"Hello. I have been a lurker around here for some time, mainly because I haven't ridden a bike in years, since I was a teen. However, now I am finally in a position to get back into it again and there is a 2000 Honda Blackbird that I might be able to get for a good deal, considering she needs some minor repairs, like new seat and some other ""cosmetic"" stuff, it has been without usage for quite some time.

Anyway, the reason why I made the post is to ask you guys, what you think about the bike? Is it still a bike worth getting today?

I have searched info on it, and I only saw praise, saying it is a reliable bike with little to no issues, durable, confortable, etc, etc... The negatives I saw was that you feel quite some heat on the legs (I guess due to the positioning of the air vents on the fairing), and the way the brakes work which it seems like some people don't like it. So, does it deserve the praise it gets? Because if it does, I might go through with the deal.

Also, another question. I like how the bike looks but I wanted to try and customize it a bit, mainly by making it naked, I usually do prefer a more naked look, but I'm not sure yet if I'll take that route.

Thanks in advance.",Opinion on Blackbird,"Hello. I have been a lurker around here for some time, mainly because I haven't ridden a bike in years, since I was a teen.

motorcycles,"Last year I laid my bike down in the most simple way possible- I was backing into a space, my foot slipped on some hay on the street and down I went. I know- not a wicked story or anything , but there it it. I ended up messing up my ankle and was in a boot for 6 weeks, and it killed the rest of my riding season.

This year I've been really busy with work and didn't get back on my ride until this week when my neighbor and I put a new battery on her and did an oil change. I'm happy to have her back, but I found that backing her up out of the garage I got really anxious. Now I'm nervous about going on group rides or going to bike nights because what if I slip and drop again?

motorcycles,"Hey all! I just got offered a better job and as a celebration I’m going to be buying a used 2013 Suzuki Boulevard S40 I’ve been considering for a while. I test rode it already and love it. I had wanted my second bike to be a cruiser style and if I could find one, a cruiser that wasn’t essentially a land boat. This bike really fits that bill; lightweight, has great handling for a cruiser, and wonderful low end grunt. And of course that classic cruiser comfort. It’s perfect, and the belt drive is a huge plus in my book. I love my Z400 but man, I hate the routine maintenance of the chain and that in the wet months (live in greater Seattle area, so basically most of the year) I’m going to be relubing my chain 2-3x per week.

I honestly don’t mind having to occasionally pop it off to do a basic cleaning every few weeks, but I was wondering if there were any additives I could put in my tank that would help prolong the time between those cleaning periods and help keep the jets cleaner? I read somewhere that sea foam could help with this. I know I’ll still need to clean them every once in a while due to the ethanol but any extra time between these cleanings is a plus.

The carb boots are terrible and leak fuel like there's no tomorrow. 

I wanted to test ride it to make sure that it i can navigate between gears etc. but the slipping hazard of the fuel as well as the fact that it hasnt been registered in years sorta deterred me.

motorcycles,"TDLR: Got my first bike, low sided and lost some confidence. Got back on a week later but broke down and some creep tried to talk to me, now I just don't feel safe riding at all.  


Some background info:  
I am a teenager and I got my first bike about a month ago. An old vintage Honda CB125. I got it because it was easy to maneuver, and I wanted to be able to drop it. It just sat in the owners place, so a carb cleaning is all it took, but I didn't know how to tune carbs, so I messed up some of the mixture screws and it's been running rough ever since. It had some periods where I tuned it up nicely, so I decided to register it and everything to get it on the road.  


I went for a trip after taking some laps around the city, which now seems stupid now that I am writing it out. It was going great till I hit some gravel on the road. This 180 turn was just filled with gravel and I panicked immensely. I had previous experience with gravel on my bicycle (which didn't turn out well), and it caused me to hesitate, leading me to drop the bike. I came out with just a bruised thumb since I was wearing all my gear, thankfully. I thought I trained enough to take that turn on, but apparently I needed more training.

It took me a week to finally get on my motorcycle and overcome the fear after the accident. I immediately went back to the mall parking lot where I took my MSF course, and used the markings on the road to freshen up my skills. It was relaxing being back on a bike, besides all the car drivers trying to run me off. The bike was acting up due to the carb, but I made it back home and forgot to retune it.

I went the next day to visit a friend, but the bike gave out along the way. The main jet fell out of the carb, but it just still ran really rough and wouldn't start half of the time. He met up with me halfway and we tried fixing it in an empty parking lot. A lot of fellow motorcyclists stopped by to help, which I appreciated so much, the community is amazing. Ultimately it wouldn't run consistently, but it was worth a shot.   


Then, a white Jeep pulled up right next to us and a man stepped out. He started asking us about the bike and everything, which a lot of people usually do. I wasn't too worried since it comes with owning the vintage bike, but the fact that he pulled up right next to us was worrying. He then started asking us our ages and what highschool we go to, which set off alarm bells in my head. He tried to convince us that he wasn't a creep by saying, ""Don't worry I'm not going to kidnap you."" Now, why the hell would a regular person say that? He started rambling about how he wants a bike too, and asked us if we wanted to ride with him when he gets his license.   


""21 isn't that much older you know.""  


This confirmed my suspicions from the start. My friend, oblivious to the whole situation, gave him the school we went to, our names, and his social media tag. He said something along the lines of ""you'll respond to my messages right?"" I was so scared after the fact. Luckily he left after seeing me giving him a death stare, but I wasn't really the same afterwards. Breaking down without a way home is not something I want to do regularly, especially after that incident and him knowing we live in the area. 

I'm glad that the motorcycle community is helpful and will pullover to help anytime, but after that incident I'm not sure about people pulling over to help me anymore.

Got back on a week later but broke down and some creep tried to talk to me, now I just don't feel safe riding at all.  


Some background info:  
I am a teenager and I got my first bike about a month ago. An old vintage Honda CB125. I got it because it was easy to maneuver, and I wanted to be able to drop it. It just sat in the owners place, so a carb cleaning is all it took, but I didn't know how to tune carbs, so I messed up some of the mixture screws and it's been running rough ever since. It had some periods where I tuned it up nicely, so I decided to register it and everything to get it on the road.  


I went for a trip after taking some laps around the city, which now seems stupid now that I am writing it out. It was going great till I hit some gravel on the road. This 180 turn was just filled with gravel and I panicked immensely. I had previous experience with gravel on my bicycle (which didn't turn out well), and it caused me to hesitate, leading me to drop the bike. I came out with just a bruised thumb since I was wearing all my gear, thankfully. I thought I trained enough to take that turn on, but apparently I needed more training.

It took me a week to finally get on my motorcycle and overcome the fear after the accident. I immediately went back to the mall parking lot where I took my MSF course, and used the markings on the road to freshen up my skills. It was relaxing being back on a bike, besides all the car drivers trying to run me off. The bike was acting up due to the carb, but I made it back home and forgot to retune it.

I am a newbie biker &amp; have been riding around on my ‘22 Kawasaki Vulcan S for over a week now after my MSF course. 

I have had a really smooth riding experience so far, but am a bit confused on the gear shifting for this specific bike especially since it’s new. 

The actual manual gave me this ridiculous guideline for shifting gears that I didn’t even see till after riding for a while: 

1st to 2nd: 9mph
2nd to 3rd: 15mph
3rd to 4th: 21mph 
4th to 5th: 27mph

I don’t know anything about this sort of thing, but this doesn’t feel right to me whatsoever. I was wondering is this just a guideline for the “break in period” or is this for some other purpose? It doesn’t mention anything about this being a temporary thing. 

What RPMs should I be idling at? Especially on this 650cc bike. Also, the downshifting guide is even more bizarre so at what speed should I be downshifting safely at? (I am guilty of leaving the clutch pulled in and downshifting multiple gears when rolling towards a sudden stop usually only within the city) 

Will the bike run significantly different after the break in period? I can ride it fine, but I want to ride it great and most efficiently.

motorcycles,"Specific question to a specific subset of riders.

For those who ride heavier ADV bikes (&gt;200 kilos/450 lbs), have you used a high front fender? What are your experiences with how it affects your on-road handling (particularly crosswinds) and has it been worth it for off-roading?

I have a Triumph Scrambler 1200 and am wondering about the pros and cons of raising the front fender. I'm aware that in *general*, low fenders are much more practical for heavy ADV bikes, but there's a few reasons I'm thinking about raising it:

1). I don't particularly like the look of the stock fender, but as far as I can tell it's the only low fender option available for my bike. So I have an aftermarket fender but it can only be installed in the high position.

2). Said aftermarket fender is custom painted to match the rest of the bike, so I want to put it in a position where it can avoid some damage from getting bashed by a rock in the tires. 

3). High fenders will lead to water and mud kickback onto the radiator, but I don't plan to intentionally take my Scrambler to gnarly muddy conditions; most of my off-roading is in dry conditions. I do ride in the rain but only on the street.

Was a high fender worth the trouble, or should I just suck it up and stick with the stock low fender? Or maybe try to modify the aftermarket fender so it can be installed in the low position?",ADV Riders: Your experiences with high front fenders?,"Specific question to a specific subset of riders.

motorcycles,"Hey yall. Here with a 2006 GSX-R 600 having an issue with my valves. It's probably, definitely related to my STVA because it randomly throws up C28/C29. When I say randomly throws it, I mean RANDOM. Anyway, what happens is when turning the key and flipping the kill switch, my valves twitch superfast (I'll def post of video when I can). 

What happens is they've been open for the longest, don't even know when that started. When I go WOT, they open all the way and after getting back to the lower rev range, they close back. They open back up properly, but don't close back unless I got WOT again. When I shut the bike off, the valves are typically open, and that of course affects my cranking. I've also found this all has affected my low end power and being in the lower rev ranges feels very jittery, even moreso than it usually does on a supersport.

Another thing I've noticed, and possibly the worst symptom, is past 8k rpm, I essentially misfire. I lose power in the sense that I could be at 11k and drop down to 7k for a split second. In the worst cases, it has gone from 10k down to 0 rpm. Again, it picks back up a split second later, but ideally it wouldn't happen at all. This really happened all at once outta nowhere, and until I find a fix, I've just been riding below 8k rpm and REALLY watching my throttle inputs. A guy I'm working with on this is saying we need to swap the whole STVA, but that part is only sold with the whole throttle body.

Really just wanna know if anyone else has any experience/advice on this. Did you check the battery comments are also appreciated.",GSX-R 600 Valve Issue,"Hey yall.

The part regarding electric vehicles starts on page 366. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather in a quick read through, the bill references clean vehicles, and it references all qualified electric vehicles. There is no differentiation between cars and motorcycles in the bill. Almost all motorcycles will qualify, since the threshold is new motor vehicles under $55 thousand dollars MRSP. In order to qualify, the battery will need to be bigger than 7 kilowatt hours, which existing electric motorcycles easily exceed (The livewire 1 is 15.5).

&amp;#x200B;

People who make under $150k/year qualify for this tax credit, and it is up to $7500, with no cap on number of vehicles sold by the manufacturer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that's not the most interesting thing - The bill also includes a credit if you buy an electric vehicle second hand. That incentive is 30% of the used vehicle's value, up to $4000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Consider this - The Livewire Del Mar is (allegedly, not entered production yet) an 80hp, 440lb electric scrambler priced at $15,000 with 100 mile range. A similar gas bike in the Ducati Scrambler Urban Motard is 76 hp, 432lb priced at $11,695. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the $7500 tax credit, the Livewire Del Mar is now only $7500. Significantly undercutting the Ducati. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not all. If we say that a similarly used Livewire and Ducati both depreciate 40%, than a used Livewire Del Mar should be $4500, while the Ducati would be $7017. However, the Livewire will be getting a second tax credit, making the final price $3150.","If the inflation reduction act passes under its current form, electric motorcycles will qualify for the same tax credit as electric cars in the USA. It will make electric motorcycles very price competitive, and maybe even cheaper than their gasoline counterparts","Full text here: [ERN22335 (documentcloud.org)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf)

motorcycles,"I'm currently well on my way to getting an A1 license as a 16yo in Norway. So far, everything (including the basic theory needed for any license, $330) has cost me around *2050* dollars, and I've only just finished the evaluation of my driving for stage 2 of getting the license (essentially, some maneuvers in a parking lot). All in all, it's going to cost me around $4700-$5000 (seems insane, I know, but I don't have anyone to ride with privately to save money). 15 hours of theory, and 10 hours of riding so far, with around 16 more to go. All for a license that I can ride a 125cc on. I think it's reasonable to require someone to go through a long-ass course to ride a motorized vehicle that can potentially endanger others on the road. 

However, I also had a look at the laws for a few different US states, spoke to a few friends from there, and I really can't understand how someone can get a license with minimal training, and buy a liter bike, at the age of *18*. Not sure about 16yos, because of how cluttered the results were when I tried to find out what the laws were.

motorcycles,"Hey guys,

New to this sub, so thanks for having me! Question for you all…sorry for the long post but it adds some color to the entire situation.

I was recently at a dealership that had a new Trail 125 in stock and I was thinking about pulling the trigger if everything checked out. I had an appointment last Thursday at 5:30, so relatively close to closing time. I informed my saleswoman that I wanted to be able to see the bike fully built so I can sit on it, feel the breaks, shifter…the works. She let me know that the bike on the floor was sold, but if it was picked up, they’d have a new one built. 

I get to the dealership, the bike isn’t there, and none are built (they had 3 in the box). She told me she’s sorry that it isn’t ready (after I had to ask why it wasn’t built), then proceeded to give me the order sheet to see what the out the door cost is. We’ll, it was $6,400. I thought the dealer fees of 1500 were way too much but I thought I’d entertain them. When I was asked if I wanted to pay cash or finance, I figured I’d check the rates to see what my options are. After filling out the questionnaire/credit applications, only one quote came back from a third party while the Honda financing was still being processed. I was told to come back on Saturday where we could discuss the Honda financing and see a completed bike. I left the dealership with no intention on buying the bike due to the high fees. 

Fast forward to Monday, I received an email from Honda Powersports that said my new credit card will arrive in 10 business days. I called the dealership to ask why I received this email, and they said they forgot to explain the process to me and to cancel if I don’t want the credit card. I was furious they opened a credit card without my approval and didn’t even know what it was meant for. When I called Honda and Citibank (the issuer of the card), they told me that is not the usual business practice and they are opening an investigation on the dealership. 

Can someone help explain to me if this whole situation is normal? From the bike not being there, to the high dealership fees, and opening a credit card without having any information on it?

Obviously he wouldn't be able to ride it on the road from the impound but will this pose an issue when comes to retrieving the vehicle at all?,UK LAW Is it possible to retrieve an impounded 600cc with a provisional licence., So a mate of mine has recently had his bike impounded by the police.

motorcycles,"I have a mysterious problem with an 1982 Honda xl185s. It starts and runs reasonably well. New carburator.

Sometimes when driving, it looses all power at the low end (if the throttle isn't all the way on it seems to start cutting out). Yesterday I rode 50 miles and it happened about 3 times. Then it starts up again, sometimes with a bit of difficulty, but not much. If I detect it's loosing power and I take the throttle off, then it stops. So somehow if I keep the throttle up higher it won't cut out. But sometimes it still does. Again this isn't every time I ride. I can go 20 min of continuous riding without an issue.

First I suspected a fuel problem. But it has a new carburator and fuel tank is full. Then after reading online I started suspecting an electrical problem. But one strange thing is that it restarts. I thought it could be related to how hot the bike is, but why would it restart? Battery is charged. I use higher octane gas.

I've read about issues with the stator, cdi, etc.

I suspect an electrical problem based on research, but that isn't for sure.  Thoughts on this issue?

I saw a 125 that i really liked but the more i thought about it and talked to people im thinking ill be bored of it after 6 months or so but my counter argument would be i can get any bad habits out my system and build my 2 wheel experience on a low powered bike before getting something more powerful in a year or 2.

250-400cc circa 40bhp

motorcycles,"I’m a new rider who has driven manual cars before and understand idea behind engines, clutches, and transmissions. But, my question is, why do manual car drivers call it the bite point, while motorcycle riders call it the friction zone if, from my understanding, they mean the same thing?

Also when I took the MSF course I asked the instructor why slipping the clutch (or riding the friction zone) is fine on a motorcycle since when you do that in a car you can easily mess up the clutch really fast. She said “motorcycle clutches are just made for that purpose”.

But, my question is, why do manual car drivers call it the bite point, while motorcycle riders call it the friction zone if, from my understanding, they mean the same thing?

Also when I took the MSF course I asked the instructor why slipping the clutch (or riding the friction zone) is fine on a motorcycle since when you do that in a car you can easily mess up the clutch really fast. She said “motorcycle clutches are just made for that purpose”. So my next question is, what makes them different? is it the material? is it cause motorcycle engines just aren’t as powerful as car engines?

motorcycles,"Hey all,

So wasn't able to ride the bike for two weeks - got it today and started with what was supposed to be a simple uturn in a parking lot that I was able to do without a problem previously before the two week hiatus. I totally botched it and had to put my foot down like I was riding back in the MSF with people looking at me lol. Hit my confidence a bit until I did some practice and sharpened it back up again however I was shocked at how I wasn't able to do it only after two weeks of not riding. 

This made me a bit worried as I found it odd not to be able to do something so trivial after only two weeks. I am wondering does this happen to any of you after not riding for some time? If so, is two weeks a good amount of time to get something wrong or do I just suck - basically what I am trying to figure out? What about winters, what do you guys do/notice after 4-5 months off?

This is my first seasons - 2 months in - so I haven't experienced moto hibernation yet and now I really wonder how bad I will be after 5 months off if two weeks caused me a bit of a problem.

It's a 91 nighthawk 750 that ran great until it recently had a fuel leak. I fixed the issue which seems like it was a fuel float that was sticking open.

After reinstalling the carbs, the bike will turnover without issue and it will idle, but it dies when I give it gas. 

I've checked my jets and they're all clear, the carbs overall are very clean inside.

One of my float bowl gaskets is pretty worn down, I thought I may have had a vacuum leak through the gasket so I used some gasoline compatible liquid gasket to make sure I had a nice seal on the float bowl. (I'd rather buy the gasket but I'm in a time crunch)

The air filter is new and clean, and currently there's no fuel filter that could be clogged 

It runs with and without the choke

When I give it gas it can take a tiny amount but it bogs down and makes a short ""psst"" sound now and then, if I give it much more it dies.

Any troubleshooting tips for this would really be great right now. Thanks guys.",Moving in a few days and my bike won't start..,"So I'm moving in 3 days and I've got a bike that won't run currently.

Bought used from a dealer this year with ~10k on the odo. 

New~ish tires, still have deep treads to them 

The first 6-700 miles on it this year had no issues. The bike felt tight on corners and acceleration. 

Now all of a sudden it feels loose. I thought it was tramlining or road snakes but it happens on every road now. 

Make a pass, rear wheel feels loose, almost like there is space for it to wobble. 

Accelerate and you feel the speed wobble that wasn't there before. 

Take a curve and you come out with a little nudge in the rear from the wheel being .. off.

I've jacked it up and things all seem right. I let it spin on the stand and visually it seems straight.

motorcycles,"Where I have stopped giving a fuck what people think.

I love my wife and would do anything for her.

That being said, I started dating my wife and then we got married in 2016. Prior to that, I was riding a 2004 Suzuki GS500F then a whateveryear Honda XR650L (way too tall for me). I gave it up to save face for my in-laws-to-be. They are very tightly knit, they gain a perspective and they all adopt it and they all stand by it. Such is the case with motorcycles. One of the brother is an ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor and all the things associated with having seen the worst of the worst accompanied that relationship at the beginning of our courtship. And that's all worthwhile and should be considered when planning for riding safety, but I was already a very safe rider with good jackets that have armor and/or padding, good helmets, boots, gloves and all.

They're more of an I/O, on-off, all or nothing kind of family in a few ways. This on top of a massive time commitment - think every week or every other week dinners, immediate and extended family reunions yearly (two separate occasions), etc. They have an excellent family life and they like it, but I was not raised with as intense a family connection as them. 

So I (31) had a talk with my wife about how I felt like I was losing myself because I couldn't keep on top of keeping up the house and property, the family time obligations, and have meaningful spans of time to do things I love like camping, and felt pressured to behave certain ways (e.g. not drinking alcohol, no motorcycles, no flight school, etc). For the purposes of this post - and barrier of entry - camping and motorcycling are easily achieved if I just have the time.

So I told her that for 7 years I felt like, through no fault of her own necessarily, I had been behaving in ways to keep the family relations copacetic despite my true loves in life and that I'd be regaining ground for my own happiness and that would mean a little more time to myself and less dedicated to her family. I'd be so pumped if she wanted to do these things with me but I absolutely would understand if she wanted to hang out with her family while I camped or went on trips, etc.

So last week, I told her I'd be looking for a new motorcycle. I found a great deal on a 2015 FJ-09 which is certainly interesting to me now that I'm 31 and am concerned with fun + riding position and practicality. So after looking at ads, test riding, and going to powersports shops, I hit up the guy about his bike and went this morning to test ride it. FELL. IN. LOVE. AGAIN. He lowered his asking price to an excellent offer and I bought it. Been riding it all day and could not be happier (unless my wife wanted me to get her a little TU250x and learn to ride).

I wouldn't call this a midlife crisis but it certainly feels like I'm regaining myself in a meaningful way. She's been warming up to the bike, too.

I've dismantled part of the bike, spark plugs are good and have spark but front one was dry so no fuel. For the front cylinder knock, I could hear it even when the cylinder did not fire. I checked valve clearance out of the four valves only one of the two exhaust is too tight, could that be the knock? I bought the tool to adjust clearance and waiting for it to arrive.

motorcycles,"I've had my bike nearing a year now.

Before that year is up I'll have put more miles on the bike than the original owner did in 4. 

I've even put off riding at times to prep for some engine work I wanted to do, or try to save on some money because gas prices went bonkers.

I used to be daily rider, until I broke up with my exgf. Then I didnt have a reason to commute anymore, and even so, I still put 2000 miles on the bike since then like it was no big deal. If I had not wanted to do some engine upgrades, I'd have easily blown past double the mileage months ago.

A short while ago, I went on a 300mile round trip, unplanned, no idea where was going, no plan, nothing. I just got on my bike and ended up 150miles away from home, got tired went back. Just because the bike was there and I could.

So... I really do not understand how people buy a motorcycle and not put thousands and thousands of miles on them a year.

Before that year is up I'll have put more miles on the bike than the original owner did in 4.

motorcycles,"Okay, so I’ve always had this aspiration in the back of my mind that one day I want to be able to ride a motorbike as it seems so cool and fun. I’m now at that moment where I want to do things for myself and this is one of those things I want to achieve. However, I’m struggling to understand what I need to do in order to pursue this.

I’m a 22 year old from the UK that has a full driving licence for 5 years and I see that there is different categories: AM, A1, A2. I think I come into A2 as I’m over 19 and not yet 24 to go the direct route for no limit on power for a bike. Obviously I’m not gonna want to go crazy and get a 1000cc bike as a beginner lol. 

I’m just trying to get the facts straight from experienced bikers who had to deal with this! I don’t need a provisional licence in order to start riding a bike as I have a full driving licence but I do need to complete my CBT course, correct? Once that is done, I then need to do my theory and a 2 part practical test in order to ride a bike up to 35kw. Once that’s done, I can then look into getting my own bike and enjoying that cool lifestyle? Please correct me if I’m wrong or missed any details!

If anyone has some advice or tips as well then it would be greatly appreciated!

motorcycles,"I recently bought a NC700X, and to say the bike is tall is an understatement. I came from riding a 50cc Cali Classic scooter, so the height at first was very daunting.

The first thing I did was buy a set of Soupy's performance lowering links, but after all the stories of handling issues I had read, I held off on lowering the bike. So the links and kick stand set on my counter, and collected dust. 

 I LOVE this bike though, so I practiced a lot. 

After about two weeks, I decided to take the seat off and shave some foam off, this took me from being on my tippy toes, to the balls of my feet. 

This gave me a lot of confidence. 

Recently I took a trip from MD to NC and back. Getting off on a exit, when I went to stop the ground on one side was lower then expected, and I nearly lost balance and dropped the bike. Partly my fault for grabbing too much front break, but also not confidence inspiring. 

When I got home, I knew it was time. I installed the lowering links, lowered the front fork, and installed the kickstand. It was like night and day. I could finally firmly plant my feet, I felt more confident coming to stops. Not worrying about if I am straight enough, or stopping to hard is such a relief. I can actually back the bike up in most situations too, and push it forward with ease also. 

The bike handles the same also. I almost feel like it handles better just because I am not so afraid of dropping it. 

Moral of the story, bikes come in one size fits most, if your bike doesn't fit you, install mods that make the bike fit you. For some that's a loud exhaust, for others that's a set of links that makes the bikes just a bit lower. 

Don't be like me and get wrapped up in the people saying that it's going to change how your bike handles. However, always start with your seat before you do your links lol.",Don't be afraid to lower your bike,"I recently bought a NC700X, and to say the bike is tall is an understatement.

Stats wise, I'm 5'5' and 70kg. I won't be planning to get a bigger bike until next year to get some NCD (plus I'm only doing my DAS next week). 

The bikes that I currently have in mind are the SV650 and the NC750S. I'm also looking for bikes in the second hand market as insurance in London for younger riders are INSANE if they're new. They pretty much charge 3-4k£ and that's for TP+F&amp;T. Might as well get a new bike every year at that cost. I'd love to get the NC750X instead but the older model has a seat height of 830mm and I think that'll be way too high for me...

Intentions for my bike will of course include enjoying a ride out on good weather but it will also be a commuter bike for me. I will also likely be taking pillions frequently which is why, as a newish rider, I'm a slight be worried to get a too tall of a bike for me as that additional instability if I'm on tip toes or even worse, one foot with a pillion could lead to some fairly troubling situations (aka faceplants). Storage is also important for me, which is why at present I'm slightly leaning towards NC as it has a frunk along with potential to add panniers and top box.

I was wondering if anyone had stories, regrets or info regarding helmets matte and gloss black.

I've been really having trouble. I've owned matte in the past and it got sticky after years of use but I was okay with that because I had it for 5 years before it really got to that point.
I've owned gloss and it looked kinda scratched up where as when the matte scratched up I felt like it looked kinda good?

I'm inbetween the 2 finishes. Can't decide which is more versatile. I feel like the gloss would look nice with a decal or two not sure if matte would be able to pull that off as well.
On the other hand I see matte being more versatile for a various range of bikes.(I ride a wide range)

Any input are super appreciated.",Can't decide between black and matte.,"https://imgur.com/a/33QS4Ar

motorcycles,I had a plan to sell my motorcycle before moving across the US but the buyer pulled out last minute. Now I’m stuck with my bike and I have to figure out how to pack it into a moving truck. Luckily I planned ahead and got a larger truck with a ramp just in case. I’ve got one week to figure this out before I pick up the moving truck and head out. We’re driving about 2000 miles over five days. I checked the uhaul website and they don’t have any trailers in stock in my area. My best option now is to pack it in the truck. Any tips or suggestions for preparing it for transport and packing it? It’ll be in the truck with everything else I own so I’ve got to make it fit safely and securely in a way that won’t impact loading up the truck. I plan on buying some good ratcheting straps but other than that I’m at a bit of a loss here… any help would be appreciated.,Tips and suggestions for preparing/packing a bike for transport in a moving truck?,I had a plan to sell my motorcycle before moving across the US but the buyer pulled out last minute.

motorcycles,"When I was much younger and started riding, I started on a sport bike, and thought they were the coolest things ever. I'm starting to think that isn't the case. Over the course of my past few years riding I have ridden a few 600c sport bikes, a hyper naked, supermoto, and a couple cruisers, and can confidently say that i'm starting to understand why majority of people simply do not ride sport bikes on the street, or maybe i'm getting too old or out of shape?  


Stop and start? Sport bikes suck. Traffic? Sport bikes suck. Instant ""get up and go"" torque? Sport bikes suck. Slow speed maneuvers like U-turns? Sport bikes suck. Commuting? Sport bikes suck. Going 160mph in a 70? They're great at that if you love the idea of having your motorcycle impounded. Mountain roads or twisty roads? Great at that, but if you hit a patch of sand or gravel or dirt the wrong way and that could be death or an oncoming traffic collision (probably death too).   


Hyper nakeds (mt-10, zh2, superduke, etc) seem to largely have the performance of a sport bike (or sometimes a tad better) in the quickness category, are better at low speed handling, and basically better at every category except being faster on high speed cornering and all-out top speed (140+mph).

motorcycles,"5’7” female, been riding a 2005 Honda Rebel for… 6-7 years? I have a need for speed and ready to upgrade but having trouble figuring out what’s next. 

What I want:
More than 250cc
Front and rear disk brakes
Fluid clutch
Naked bike or minimal fairings
General look- I like the angled look, the classic flat lines like the Bonneville and the lines of my current bike do not appeal to me. (Not sure how to best describe what I like.. more racer-like?)
Ride in a city, commuting and short fun rides
I’d rather carry my stuff on my back than have a saddle bag

What I’ve tried (test ride):
2004 Triumph Bonneville 
2006? Harley Sportster (something)
Brand new Indian scout (something) and FTR 

Notes:
Triumph —was a nice ride, though the clutch was tough on my grip strength. Don’t love the bulky or classic look
it’s heavy but definitely manageable

Harley— scared me. Took so much throttle to get going and was immediately balls-to-wall accelerating (after stalling out a few times trying to find how much it needed)
Didn’t mind the power, but the low end power/speed didn’t feel right for the riding I’d be doing
Didn’t love the look

Indian scout— rides nice, no complaints except price and not exactly the style I want. It looks like a much, much nicer version of my Rebel 

Indian FTR— love love love this one. Only complaint is price. 

I guess I’m looking for alternatives to FTR (new/used) that might be less than $7K that I can try next. Was interested in the monster until I learned that it has dry clutch… I don’t want to break anything from riding the friction zone in traffic, doing turns, etc. A friend suggested a BMW ( forget model ) but assuming they are just as expensive, though I’m sure I’d love it and would look past the “beak”",Suggest me my next bike,"5’7” female, been riding a 2005 Honda Rebel for… 6-7 years?

motorcycles,"In my younger years I was big into quad bikes, so I've been motorcycle-adjacent, but it's been a while.

I'm nearly-30 and considering selling my car and buying something like a Royal Enfield Classic 350. Money is getting a bit tight, and my car is worth more than the 350 should be. The car is having some issues, which is encouraging my decision here, plus used car prices are crazy high.

Anyway, so my questions are

1. Is a bike really practical for primary transportation? It would be mainly city driving with some light highway use (up to 60 usually, MAYBE up to 70mph). I live in a river basin, so we get lots of bad weather.

2. How does one deal with riding in bad weather if needed?

3. Is a Royal Enfield 350 Classic a good choice? I like the old school look, and reviews seem to say it's a good starter bike. I was always comfortable on 350-400 quads, so it seemed alright to me. Is RE good, reliable, easy to work on, a good deal? Is there a better option available?

I'm moving to west coast from east coast and plan to take my iron883 Sportster with me.

This seems very economical otherwise I would end up spending 1.5k more on moving the motorcycle just by itself. So I have some questions for the OGs and folks more experienced with moving motorcycles:

1. Has anyone done this before OR something similar? If yes, any tips for packing the motorcycle with other stuff and how to prop it straight so that it doesn't get damaged during the move?   
\- I plan to cut one of my extra mattress in half and then sandwich the motorcycle between them while resting one mattress piece against the side wall. After that, I'll fill the space with cushions/comforters etc. From the other side, I'll put moving boxes with heavy stuff so that the bike sandwich doesn't have a lot of wiggle room.
2. Should I drain all the fluids? If yes, any steps to follow to drain and then refill and start? I'm definitely removing the battery as well. They said they won't check if I have drained them but rely on the honour code of the customer. I don't know if it could be hazardous.

\- I plan to cut one of my extra mattress in half and then sandwich the motorcycle between them while resting one mattress piece against the side wall. After that, I'll fill the space with cushions/comforters etc. From the other side, I'll put moving boxes with heavy stuff so that the bike sandwich doesn't have a lot of wiggle room.
2. Should I drain all the fluids? If yes, any steps to follow to drain and then refill and start? I'm definitely removing the battery as well. They said they won't check if I have drained them but rely on the honour code of the customer. I don't know if it could be hazardous.

thanks.Anyone has shipped a motorcycle in U-box? \"
motorcycles,"It's pretty hot here today (97F/36C) and I've been out delivering for about three hours. At my last pickup I noticed a steady stream of bubbles in my fuel filter (glass, see through) it then stalled on me after about a mile. Important to note, my bike is air cooled. 

I've never seen a significant amount of bubbles in my air filter, and certainly not when the filter was full of fuel. Did my fuel filter get too hot and prevent fuel flow to my carbs somehow? The fuel filter is glass and metal, and was too hot to touch. 

After about twenty minutes it fired back up. Waiting another twenty before I head home.","Fuel filter had a steady streams of bubbles, then bike died and wouldn't start","It's pretty hot here today (97F/36C) and I've been out delivering for about three hours.

motorcycles,I’m looking for my first motorcycle and I love the husky bikes. I want the Svartpilen but they are no where to be found in LA.

motorcycles,"Hey all, brand new rider here. As in, licensed and registered last friday and I've put maybe 10 miles on it, mostly in a parking lot, one stretch of straight road where I got up to 40mph. Today, it was 75 degrees after a hot spell and I was excited but a little nervous to take the bike out onto the road (football practice and increased activity at the parking lot I've been using) and get some shifting practice which I'm getting better at. The road I was planning to take has some big curves and well, I'm sure glad I didn't because two blocks from my house, turning right at a stop sign, I somehow lost control of the bike and dropped it--it happened so fast that one second I was thinking, crap I'm not gonna make this turn, and the next second, the rear wheel hits my leg and I'm standing in the street like ""oh &amp;%#!"". The bike is okay, I think, I got it back upright, rode home very carefully, took it to the parking lot to work on turning and after ten minutes I was still pretty nervous so went home. 

Now--I have turned right from a stop a couple times and even executed it almost perfectly once, and turning when I'm moving is a lot easier for me although I still go wide most of the time. Yes, I took the MSF class and the 90 degree turns and U-turns were the only things I could just not do (somehow made the u-turn during the evaluation) and I did pass for the record, BUT I wore composite toe boots the first day and could not shift from first to second to save my life--near the end of the day, I switched to a Honda Rebel and it was a night and day difference. So after practically failing everything the first day, I had only a few hours to play catch up before the evaluation and I REALLY wish I could restart the course on the Rebel. Unfortunately, they ended the MSF program in my state (IL) this June and I got into one of the last batch of classes otherwise you bet I'd just take it again. 

I digress--so I dumped my bike over in the street trying to make a right turn from a stop. WTF. I was still in the friction zone, so wasn't going fast at all, but I think when I pulled in the clutch in panic, it felt like I was gaining speed somehow and all I could see was the big ditch I was about to ride into so I may have hit the front brake--either way it has completely destroyed what little confidence I had in myself, and the bike even though I know it is my fault. I don't understand what my problem is, because I'm looking to where I want to go and yet my turns/u-turns are either way too wide or complete failures. Sorry for the huge rant, I don't know if it's trust issues on my end or something technical I am failing to do, I would be incredibly grateful for any advice!!

Also, my bike is a 2003 Kawasaki Vulcan 500, 11k miles, seems to be in good condition. The internet said it is a great starter bike and the guy who sold it to me said it's small enough to learn on, and big enough to want to keep for a few years before upgrading. It was the only one in my price range, there were some Rebel 250s but they were 15-20 years old and like $3500 which I thought was way too steep. I am a complete noob though so what do I know.

Bought a project 2001 F4i yesterday for $1500. The bike has 22k miles and seems to be completely stock besides the manual CCT and a slip on exhaust.

Previous owner said he was riding on the interstate and it died on him, couldn't get it started and didn't want to mess with it any further.

&amp;#x200B;

Tore into it a bit yesterday with a friend to try and get it started. A few of the things we checked:

Battery voltage- voltage is fine, engine will crank but won't start

Sparkplugs- we only checked a single plug, and it was getting spark. Haven't checked the other plugs but buddy said that was a good sign that the rest of the plugs are sparking also.

Coils- I took the coils off this morning and checked them with my multimeter, they all showed about the same readings so I'm assuming they're fine.

Fuel Pump &amp; Injectors- We can hear the fuel pump whine when the key is turned on, we took the fuel rail off and can see the fuel spraying from the injectors. We tried starting the bike using starting fluid and were able to get it running for a few moments, it would run for maybe 6 seconds at the longest but would shut off right away if I moved the throttle any. 

Compression- went and picked up a compression testing kit from Harbor Freight to test compression but we weren't able to get it threaded into the plug hole for some reason, so we returned it. My buddy put his hands over the throttle body while I tried to start the thing and they were sucking his hand in pretty good. He said that was a sign of good compression. Is that true or should I try to check the compression with a kit again? 

Pink wire?- we checked the voltage on a pink wire, not exactly sure what it is for but he said it's a common issue on my bike. Voltage read 8.5 so he said that was fine. 

At the end of the day he suggested that we try new plugs and if those don't help he thinks the timing may be off. 

Do any of you have any advice on what else we should check on? I'm not very mechanically inclined at all so any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

I got this bike yesterday, it’s a Suzuki Katana 600F with about 20k miles . This bike doesn’t run and sat for a year(maybe more not sure) today I spend the entire day trying to figure out the problem. Let me start off by saying this bike doesn’t even turn, no dashes on the screen, nothing. I made sure the battery is good and still nothing, changed the spark plugs and still nothing. I’m not really someone who knows a lot of bike. I did my best to try to get this starting but I can’t. Any advice is helpful, if someone is closer in the Milwaukee WI area and is willing to come out and look at it in person that would be nice, And of course I will pay to. 

Back story, the person I got this bike from said he drove it for a few days last summer, it work perfect. Then all of a sudden one morning he tired turning it on and got nothing. Not even a turn, just start silence.

Pretty sure carbs might need cleaning if someone can do that to but I do have all fearings taken off, gas tank, and seat. 

Also I did empty the gas tank and it was just rust and gas. I sprayed it down with water and cleaned it with brake cleaner now it’s just air drying until I can get the bike running. 

Thank you for reading my essay hope you can leave feedback on what I should do.",I NEED HELP PLZZ.,"

motorcycles,"Hey all, It finally happened. Walked outside at 2:00am to move my bike into my garage and found it knocked over onto the right side.

Not sure if this was a failed attempt to steal it where the robber bailed, vandalism, or someone sitting on it and knocking it over when getting off.  


Anyways any thoughts on whether this is worth reporting to the police? I have no evidence of it being malicious or even someone else so I'm not sure if it would do much good.

I’ll kick it off — a friend told me when I was just learning to think of my traction as an HP meter. When you’re riding straight and fast you’re at close to 100%. When you take a turn and you’re not on the center of the wheel you use up some HP. When you shift, you use some more. When you don’t look where you’re going: even more. Use up too much of your “traction meter” and you’ll go down.

motorcycles,"15 years ago I learned how to pack ride, properly imo, bar to bar, tire to tire with the guys in front and behind you, doesn't matter if we were freeway or backroads, it was a 2 wide angry road snake of Harleys going as fast as possible. Operating on head coms and hand/foot signals, designated traffic blockers so the whole pack made it when there was 40+ riding, we were on the quick nimble bikes made for blocking, it was highly organized chaos, really cool to watch as well. Rode like that with bros for 10 years, never any accidents, issues, always had a chase cage. 

Since those days gone, I've hopped into some random pack rides on highways, generally people are sloppy, hopscotching each other, piss poor lane and throttle control, zipping in and out of cars randomly with absolutely no flow or caution. Never know where your buddies or other riders are, and have seen a few accidents.

I've traversed the country top to bottom with a group of 10 guys travelling 90+ the whole way, never more that 2 feet from each other, rain or shine, traffic or not.

Maybe because of the communication built over the years, or we all had over 100k miles in the saddle. 

Now, TALK ALL THE SHIT YOU WANT, but I think us Harley guys are empirically better high speed pack riders. Maybe that's just the way I was learned. Not doubting any good streetbike rider could out pace me on my Dyna any day of the week. But I've seen some pretty reckless pack tendencies come out of the streetbike community, with often fatal consequences.

motorcycles,"Tldr at bottom. A rant with little bit of ""am I the asshole?""

Went for a ride yesterday. Originally just myself, a mate and one of his work mates. I've never enjoyed big group rides, so generally keep it to 3.

My mates a learner, but only by paperwork.  Dude can ride, but needs an open rider nearby.   I've been riding 20 years and happy to head out with him.

Get to the meeting point and his work mates invited 3 other open riders and another learner with a pretty rooted bike.  Brakes low, bar ends loose, chain floppy, plus he almost dropped it at a set of lights.  In Australia, we have to do a practical pre-learner course, this stuff should have been ironed out before he even got on the road.

Immediately I realise one of the new comers is one of ""those"" riders that knows everything.   Picking apart this poor learners bike ""oh you'll have to get it towed"".  Yes the bike was rough, but hardly tow worthy.

And she said ""we're going to keep riding.. you'll be right getting home?""

Learner! Has to have full licence supervision.

So we drop him back home. All 7 of us.  As my suggestion of one person escorting and catching up later on the twisties instead of convoying through the fucking suburbs was laughed at.  Off we all go and drop the learner off at home.

So I've got a friend on the back of a rental cbr500.  First time on a bike for her and I've done all of 5km on the bike in stop/start traffic.  Had to do a U turn on a tight quiet dead end street, so I just wobbled my way around idling the bike as my pillion was still doing little movements and hadn't yet worked out how much difference that makes (she was awesome by the end of the day btw! Tipping the bike in smoothly, we nudged out those chicken strips nicely)

This made old love think I was some kind of noob.  On a somewhat busy 4 lane highway, she became insistent I stick within 1 second of the group who are now about 6 seconds ahead of me - enough space for a car to get between me and the convoy ahead who are all within half a second of each other and in each other's blind spots/swerve zones.

She's hanging around behind me in my swerve zone, ducking left to right with eratic speed, constantly changing lanes and motioning ""Speed up! hurry up""

After about 5 minutes of telling her to go ahead, I just gave her the finger and lit up the brake light.

She blasts off ahead, swerves over a lane cutting a car off with her hand out in a ""stop there"" motion, motioning the group ahead of her to change lane.  This happened a couple more times, with cars tooting and throwing their hands up at her.

We did catch up by the exit, cruising at the speed limit in the slow lane.

Next roundabout, I just took a different exit and left to do our own thing.  Pulled over up ahead to text the group chat and explain the situation to my pillion.  We had a much more relaxed ride for the rest of the day.


Back when I learned to ride, it was ""groups of 3-4, no more"", with designated meet up points if multiple groups and one gets left behind.   The smaller groups give cars a chance to change lanes between groups and not have to drastically change their speed to get around us.  I feel that's even more important these days with the higher traffic numbers.  We also didn't make people ride faster or differently than they were comfortable - unless it was dangerous to themselves.

Tldr; Planned ride of 3 turned to 7. One rider took control, insisted I stay within touching distance. I bailed. She says I shouldn't have been riding so far behind, I say she shouldn't be riding like an idiot trying to control the situation.",Group ride etiquette rant,"Tldr at bottom. A rant with little bit of ""am I the asshole?""

Went for a ride yesterday. Originally just myself, a mate and one of his work mates. I've never enjoyed big group rides, so generally keep it to 3.

My mates a learner, but only by paperwork.  Dude can ride, but needs an open rider nearby.   I've been riding 20 years and happy to head out with him.

Get to the meeting point and his work mates invited 3 other open riders and another learner with a pretty rooted bike.  Brakes low, bar ends loose, chain floppy, plus he almost dropped it at a set of lights.  In Australia, we have to do a practical pre-learner course, this stuff should have been ironed out before he even got on the road.

Immediately I realise one of the new comers is one of ""those"" riders that knows everything.   Picking apart this poor learners bike ""oh you'll have to get it towed"".  Yes the bike was rough, but hardly tow worthy.

And she said ""we're going to keep riding.. you'll be right getting home?""

Learner! Has to have full licence supervision.

So we drop him back home. All 7 of us.  As my suggestion of one person escorting and catching up later on the twisties instead of convoying through the fucking suburbs was laughed at.  Off we all go and drop the learner off at home.

At first I thought my relay was bad, so I switched it out (I have a relay made for LED blinkers), but still the same problem.  I have checked the grounding and that does not seem to be the problem. I also thought the problem might be that the voltage drops for some reason when i drive and becomes too low for the LED:s to turn on, so I hooked up a volt-meter and measured it to about 12 volt over the blinker when standing still and 13 to 14 volt when driving, so at least the voltage is not too low. Could there be some kind of over voltage protection which turns them off? The blinkers are the kind that starts with one LED then turn on the next until it fills up, so I know there are some kind of logic built into them.

At first I thought my relay was bad, so I switched it out (I have a relay made for LED blinkers), but still the same problem.  I have checked the grounding and that does not seem to be the problem. I also thought the problem might be that the voltage drops for some reason when i drive and becomes too low for the LED:s to turn on, so I hooked up a volt-meter and measured it to about 12 volt over the blinker when standing still and 13 to 14 volt when driving, so at least the voltage is not too low. Could there be some kind of over voltage protection which turns them off? The blinkers are the kind that starts with one LED then turn on the next until it fills up, so I know there are some kind of logic built into them. Or does anybody have any ideas of what the problem could be?LED blinkers stops working when driving/revving"

motorcycles," 

You would not expect to see a Kawasaki Ninja sport bike up in the mountains. Just like you would not expect to see a mountain goat place his hooves on the hot sticky asphalt of a race track. With the low ground clearance, firm suspension and slick tires lacking any usable tread, it sounds like a terrible idea. But it was actually quite brilliant.

A few miles outside of Fresno, I was riding on some beautifully paved curvy foothill roads up into Sierra. As expected, the bike performed stellar. By the end every muscle and tendon of mine was stretched and sore from holding on so tight as I tore through the twisties at the posted recommended speed limit.

That all changed when the asphalt turned to gravel. With potholes, rocks and uneven surfaces it was now my bones under attack as the bike banged and bounced. I pulled over to have a conversation involving just myself, my bike and the dirt.

I had the wrong approach. No more tight seating posture, time to  loosen up. Lean less and steer more. I stood up at the bigger bumps so the seat did not slam into my groin. Instead of constantly shifting the close ratio 6 speed transmission  for horsepower, I left it in 2nd gear and let the low end torque from the direct-injected parallel twin put in work. The change in riding had an astonishing effect.

Soon enough I did not even bother avoiding potholes. They were just not that bad. These were the kind of roads your GPS allows you a whole hour to travel just 11 miles. However, I was able to do much negotiating. I was flying up the mountain roads. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Soon enough, vehicles were moving out of the way for me. A big adventure van yielded to let me over take him. A jeep wrangler yielded as well. A freaking Jeep!  A rig with tires so knobby I could survive being run over if I just ducked between them. 

My biggest enemy has yet to come until nearly the end. Sand. My slick tires sunk right into the sand, forcing my fate. Keeping the bike straight in sand was like trying to hold onto a wet bar of soap in the shower. And like dropping the soap, it could end  a lot worse than just a handlebar up your ass. I kept light on the throttle and maintained a loose grip on the handlebars. Not in a Jesus take the wheel kinda way, but an Isaac Newton kinda way. An object in motion will stay in motion, right? I was then forcefully removed from my bike. 

Luckily sand is also soft, so I picked up my broken mirror, picked up the bike, picked up my confidence and got back on. I soon reached my well deserved campsite.

I managed to ride nearly a whole tank of gas up on the HOV roads. Enjoying every bit. It was such an unexpected outcome. I felt as if I accomplished something. Sure, many people have done it before in their dual-sport or off-road bikes, but that's what they are supposed to do. I achieved it in a Ninja. I managed to put a square peg into a round hole, something everyone has always said you cannot do. But maybe the reason you should not do something is the best reason to do it. Give it a try sometime, it might surprise you. Thanks for reading.",Wanted to share my first experience taking a Ninja off-road for camping!,"

I bought the bike couple months ago and would like to make some minor modifications to make my riding more comfortable. Also would like to see your pictures of your GSR600-s. If you have made some interesting changes you could write some details about it. 

Now to the questions:

1. Question - Bluetooth module for phone connection. 
I, unfortunetaly due to my job, have a lot of phone calls on and off the working hours. So usually when i ride i have my Airpods in and set my iPhone settings so that it answers automatically. I’m looking for a bluetooth module so when i start the bike it connects with my phone and i can configure shortcuts to set the settings automatically. 

2. Question - ‘remote’ signal. Does anyone has any idea where it is easiest to find ‘remote’ signal from electrical system.  I have a phone holder with wireless charging, but i could’t find a remote signal so right now it is powered straight from the battery and there is a switch from wich to turn off the charger, but i was hoping to find a signal so the charger turns on with the ignition.

I bought the bike couple months ago and would like to make some minor modifications to make my riding more comfortable. Also would like to see your pictures of your GSR600-s. If you have made some interesting changes you could write some details about it. 

Now to the questions:

1. Question - Bluetooth module for phone connection. 
I, unfortunetaly due to my job, have a lot of phone calls on and off the working hours. So usually when i ride i have my Airpods in and set my iPhone settings so that it answers automatically. I’m looking for a bluetooth module so when i start the bike it connects with my phone and i can configure shortcuts to set the settings automatically. 

2. Question - ‘remote’ signal. Does anyone has any idea where it is easiest to find ‘remote’ signal from electrical system.  I have a phone holder with wireless charging, but i could’t find a remote signal so right now it is powered straight from the battery and there is a switch from wich to turn off the charger, but i was hoping to find a signal so the charger turns on with the ignition. 

Thanks in advance for your answers!

motorcycles,"So After about a month of practicing everything in the driveway I road on the streets for the first time. Everything went well and it actually felt very natural, I was not nervous at all. Anyway, I passed a few other riders on my maiden journey, they gave me the wave but I didn’t do it back because I don’t yet feel stable enough to have 1 hand on the bars. Not that I’ll ever see them again but is it rude to not do it back? I’d rather not do the wave than crash lol.",Is it rude to not do the “biker wave”?,"So After about a month of practicing everything in the driveway I road on the streets for the first time.

motorcycles,"     I just picked up this 05 gsxr 600 for $800. The previous owner hit a van that pulled out on him while going 25 mph and he wrecked. It needs new fairings (the guys wife threw them away and made him get rid of the bike).
     I was trying to fit some cheap chinese fairings on but I noticed the side plastics were rubbing the front tire to the point where it was touching the rim. I measured the wheelbase and it’s about 4 inches shorter than it should be. I tried to look at the front end but I can’t tell whats bent as I’m more accustomed to working on cars, not bikes. Could someone take a look at these pictures and let me know whats wrong? Let me know if you need me to take more pics. Thanks.

motorcycles,"The title is nothing but a clickbait, but I thought I'd share.

I was just riding on a long empty road (outside a city), no traffic in front or behind me, when I notice to my left - on an elevated rail track - a train catching up with me (I was going maybe 90-100km/h, the train about 110-120km/h). So out of boredom I started matching my speed with the train, the train kept slowing down and speeding up (it was slightly curvy road and the rail track copied the road exactly), then I looked up to see the conductor looking from his window, big smile on his face, waving at me. I waved back and for a minute we just rode next to each other before I caught up with the traffic so we had to part ways.

It was such a wholesome moment that made me regret I don't have a helmet cam to capture it.

So that was my encounter with a train, sorry again for the clickbait",I just had an encounter with a train,"The title is nothing but a clickbait, but I thought I'd share.

I've seen countless riders in a t-shirt and shorts. It makes me cringe so much. It doesn't matter if you're going 50 km/h or 100 km/h, if you fall on hot asphalt, you'll get hurt. Of course you'll get hurt worse going 100, but it's still gonna be bad.

I know it's hot and sitting on a hot bike is even worse, especially when standing still, but I promise you it's better to be a little uncomfortable than lose your skin.

motorcycles,"Hi all, 

I usually wear leathers but I am looking to buy a textile suit for when I'm commuting, when it's wet out or when they're not really appropriate (going into the shop for some messages for example)

I found that it's actually hard to find a good textile suit that has level 2 armour in it. Dainese have a few jackets but then most of the trousers are level 1 (Dainese sports master suit being the exception)

Also it's quite hard to find something more geared towards sports bike riding. Most have a longer cut for touring which would get in the way and they feel bulky and cumbersome.

I feel like I'm taking a massive step backwards in the level of protection I'm wearing when I'm not in my leathers and I know I'm going to be riding at the same pace. 

Should I be looking for something with an airbag at this point?

I am going to look at my first bike. It is a 2016 KLR650. The pictures look amazing and it only has about 7000km. It looks to be in great condition with a couple scratches on the crash bars from a bit of off-roading.

However I can’t for the life of me get rider sag above 15% even on the softest preload setting and with compression damping open all the way. Is this normal on dual sports bikes?

I'm a 40 year old, 6'6"" 265lb male beginning the search for my first bike. I'm interested in weekend back road touring with the goal of eventually moving into longer trips as vacations. I have no interest in commuting or cruising in the city and I have my sights set on an ADV bike. After nearly pulling the trigger on a KLR650 as my first ""starter bike"", I'm now back to reconsidering going all-in on a slightly used BMW R1250GS, as I feel that's really the endgame here (and my big ass feels like an ape riding a roller skate on smaller - ""normal sized"" - bikes.)

I'm curious why exactly we've always heard to avoid at all costs starting out on too much motorcycle. I've always taken it as gospel but have never actually questioned what specific pitfalls await new riders on more powerful motorcycles. 

I don't know if I'm being ignorant here but I'm wondering how much of the potential for trouble lies with most first time riders and buyers tending to be in their teens and 20s and less risk-adverse? As much as it pains me to admit, those days are well behind me and I've zero interest in showing off, driving aggressively, or general thrill seeking. I've taken the beginner and advanced MSF courses already and have the patience to practice and get to know a bike - and being a used adventure bike, I'm not terribly concerned with low speed drops, as I'm certain it won't be its first or last. 

Am I being foolish here? Is this a hard and fast rule no one should be exempt from? Given these circumstances, what specifically would I gain from starting on a smaller bike? 

I'd love yalls thoughts on the matter but ask that we try to keep it constructive! Thanks!",But why???,"Everybody knows to start out small when buying your first starter bike....but why exactly?

Now that the summer is in full swing, the temp light has started flickering randomly. Mostly when I am accelerating up through 2nd, 3rd and 4th. It never stays on solid and seems to just randomly flicker when the rpm’s are in a certain band. Doesn’t flicker when downshifting usually.

The radiator fan is working and the light doesn’t flicker when sitting idle at lights. It seems kind of random.

Today I flushed and changed the rad fluid. When I opened the drain plug on the water pump the fluid was just trickling out in a slow stream. I pulled the hose at the water pump and dumped the fluid then replaced.

The system burped normally and I rode for a good 45 minutes before the flickering started again.

Does anyone know what the issue could be? Is it the water pump? Aside from the dummy light going haywire there don’t seem to be any other symptoms of overheating. The bikes runs and rides like a top.

I stalled a couple of times when starting, but overall I was feeling confident! Instructors were really encouraging, stern but nice with some feedback. I struggled a little bit on stop &gt; 1st &gt; 2nd &gt; stop, but I quickly got the hang of that one. At this point I honestly felt really comfortable on the bike, not overconfident, but on the right path. 


One drill threw me for a loop in a really bad way: ride going around the circuit, 3rd gear on the straightaways and 2nd gear on the turns. This confused me because I thought that 3rd gear would be too fast for most parking lots? And to be honest I wasn’t expecting to get out of 2nd gear during the whole course. 


Anyway, they warned me once because I shifted up to third just fine, then went down into first on the turn. My mistake was clicking the shifter down too many times, thinking that my first click didn’t work. The bike was old, and there was a lot of “play” or movement in the shifter itself. I’m not sure if this is normal or not. 3rd&gt;1st with too high RPM is dangerous because I could lock up the bike and flip, I later learned from the instructor.


I thought I was getting the hang of it, I went around the circuit and did the drill twice shifting the correct way. I made my previous mistake 3rd to 1st one more time, and I got pulled because I was making the instructor nervous and they deemed me an unsafe rider. I pulled out of the circuit on my own after making a mistake, and got scolded for turning the bike in the direction of the instructor when I wanted to ask for feedback. The instructor feedback and cues weren’t helpful to me, they basically told me I was overthinking it. it took a lot of back and forth and follow up questions in order for me to understand what I did wrong, and why this is actually unsafe. I kept a cool head and kept asking questions until i understood. 


The instructor suggested that I go to “group ride hours” where you just have free time to ride around the circuit and practice shifting, but to me this seems wrong. If I’m still getting a grasp on this drill, and my mistakes are putting myself and others in danger, to me going back to a group riding setting doesn’t seem like the best move? 


I’m inclined to sign up for a private lesson with a different organization, as a final shot to see if this hobby is even a good fit for me. I feel like before the course I watched every tutorial on shifting out there, but If anyone can point me to videos or instructionals to work on this weakness I’d appreciate that. 


I acknowledge that I didn’t have the skills to pass the course, and I would like to try and improve but honestly this failure was crushing and discouraging in a really big way. Any comments are appreciated.","Another “failed the MSF course” post. First day. I didn’t drop the bike, didn’t hit any cones, but I shifted from 3rd to 1st by mistake when I was supposed to only go down to 2nd. I got one warning, then got pulled.

motorcycles,"Hey all, I'm a new rider, my first bike has been a klr 650 that I'm struggling to feel comfortable on. I'm tall enough for it but it's heavy for me and after 4 months of riding back roads I'm still not very confident. Haven't taken it onto any main roads yet because I really haven't learned how far I can lean this thing, how hard you can brake, etc. and I'm trying to learn on these awful twisty rural roads that are 60% tar with gravel pulverized into it. 

What's worse is if they aren't bone dry, they basically look like one big oil spot, I just got new tires , shinko 244s, and went for a ride after a brief storm once the roads were more than halfway dry and I feel like if I lean over much I'm going to slide. The bike being tall and heavy doesn't help either. Is anyone more familiar with these riding conditions? Am I just psyching myself out?",how much can I trust wet roads with heavy amounts of tar?,"Hey all, I'm a new rider, my first bike has been a klr 650 that I'm struggling to feel comfortable on.

Zach graduated from Colonia High School in 2020, he was a student at Middlesex Community College and was to begin Rowan University in the fall to major in Finance. Zach’s talents were many. He enjoyed hockey, poker, being a know-it-all about everything and he truly did not know how to be boring. Zach was goofy, witty, intelligent, curious about everything, inquisitive, understanding, kind, and hilarious. He was Spontaneous, revelled in deep conversations, loved planning for his future. He was constantly coming up with inventions he was always worried about other people stealing. He was mindful, lived in the moment, was a sponge for knowledge and forward-thinking. He was also incredibly competitive. He always had his sights on the future and made sure everyone knew he was going to be an entrepreneur. The book he was reading on his nightstand was, “The Simple Path to Wealth.”  He had it bookmarked with a dollar bill on page 165. 

A 20 year old was murdered while enjoying his summer and on his way to see his girlfriend. On thursday June 16th, *Osmani Hondal* recklessly drove into Zach while he was riding his bike. Zach was in the left hand lane going straight through a green light. He was flown and killed on impact, he was flown to Robin Wood Johnson Hospital where he was kept on ventilators and life support due to no oxygen flow going to the brain. Woodbridge had another fatal motorcycle accident happen the same week on route one. Zachary was an organ donor so he was kept on machines until the 20th. He was not at fault and driving in his own home town.

Middlesex County had the most fatal accident reports compared to any other county, st georges alone has multiple motorcycle roadside memorials.  Osmani Hondal failed to look and made an illegal left hand turn that killed my brother  on impact, he did not move a mussel after the impact since the truck had its arms down and hit him which caused him to be flown off his bike .  Osmani Hondal has previous traffic records and was still allowed to drive that garbage truck, it was bound to happen one day, this could have been prevented if people cared about who they hired. Charges have still not been pressed and he is still on the road and then we wonder why there are so many negligent drivers, but a cop has no problem parking in the same spot everyday and pulling over people going 35 in a 25 on their way to work. We care about the wrong things and distract from the real issue, because who cares? The person on the bike was probably at fault and driving recklessly: This is a stigma that NEEDS to be reversed. When is New Jersey Going to Enact Change to Protect Motorcyclists? Will it ever happen? How many more people have to die for things to be changed? How many other people are driving trucks for city companies with a traffic record? Does anyone even care?

It is what we owe to each other but this world has become focused on what we owe to ourselves. In honor of Zachary Kachwalla, please be conscious of motorcyclists on the road. In a  car vs bike accident the driver of the car is usually protected while the motorcyclists are exposed. Zachary was just enjoying his life to the fullest, he loved bikes, and he was driving safe, and the speed limit. It goes to show how it really does not matter how safe of a driver you are, it is everyone else on the road that we need to be conscious of.  You cannot find his story or name in any articles and the articles that do exist are rather hard to find.

&amp;#x200B;

**To all fellow riders:** 

*Please share Zachary's story, He loved riding and knew that every time he got on his bike that it was a risk, but a risk he was willing to take because of the joy it brought him. He wouldn't of wanted to die any other way then going out on his bike, this is a life gone too soon and New Jersey needs to do something to protect the rights of motorcyclists and stop victim blaming. NJ is one of the highest populated states resulting in the largest sum of fatal accidents. Zachary Kachwalla was just one of the millions of lives taken too soon from unsafe and negligent driving.*

I have not been paying attention to the annual upgrades (like safety features etc) of these bikes so for those who know and have real experience with both bikes, has there been a lot of improvement? I want honest answer because I dont typically believe what the sales person tell me lol. If there has been upgrades, are they worth the difference in price? can u tell the difference between the old and new model when riding?  


Now, is there a specific dealership that is best dealing with that give the best discounts? Home is Florida but there are plenty of Ducati dealerships across the country. Is it possible to get any discount at all at the 2022 DS? if it's possible, how should I negotiate it? how much should I ask for without lowballing?

As an aside, how do my plugs look? Installed them in 2020. I get a lot of popping on deceleration

motorcycles,"A few days ago a problem began when I tried to shift into 5th gear. I shifted, let out the clutch, rolled on the throttle, and the engine free spun. It didn’t happen every time I shifted into 5th. Usually when it happened, shifting down into 4th then back up into 5th would fix it. Over the next couple days it became more frequent. Then yesterday, when I tried to shift from 3rd to 4th, the engine spun free in 4th and no amount of shifting down to 3rd and back up to 4th would give me the gear, the engine spun free in 4th every time and I couldn’t skip past 4th to go to 5th. When shifting down to 3rd it felt like it would bang into gear instead of the smooth click when shifting normally. When I got home I lifted the back wheel and shifted with my hand while rotating the wheel and it took a lot of force to shift to 4th and 5th. I’m currently pulling everything apart to open the trans in the hope I see something obvious with maybe the shift barrel or something but I have no idea what could be causing this.

motorcycles,"When I was 27, I owned a Kaw 900 Z1. It was very fast, and powerful. One evening I want out for a ride a nd as I pulled up to a stop sign near my home, I put on the rear brake a little too hard. I was on some gravel and the bike went right down. I got an 8 in cut on one knee which sent me home for my car. I went to an emergency room, where they stitched me up. That experience taught me to get some leather pants. A few weeks later, I was out near my home with my wife on the back. After stopping to adjust my gear, we pulled out of a parking lot to enter an expressway. I opened the throttle up to get up to 50 quickly. We happened to be on a little patch of gravel. My rear wheel spun and when I rolled a few inches, we hit good pavement. My rear tire bit in and it caused an instant wheelie. My wife was dropped on the pavement, unhurt. I was tossed several feet in the air and came down on one foot, twisting my left knee. I knew something was wrong but it wasn't until ten years later that it caught up with me. In 1989, on a spring day, I was walking in DC and my left knee gave out. In a few days, I saw an orthopedic surgeon who operated on me the next day, Memorial Day weekend, 1989. He found and repaired a torn ACL and MCL, sort of like a football player's injury. It took me a year and a half to be free of pain. Fortunately, I gave up riding a few months later. , I have no lasting effects.

motorcycles,"Hey all, I'm looking at getting a Honda CBR500 brand new from the dealer once I pass my modules in a few weeks time. My local bike shop has told me that the 500 is a bit underpowered, however for my first bike I believe it will be plenty. I live in the UK so can't go much bigger as I'll have an A2 restricted License.

People generally don't recommend a new rider to get brand new as its bound to be dropped, however some older second hand 500s are not much cheaper then buying brand new, what are your guy's thoughts?

motorcycles,"My first bike was/is a 2005 Yamaha Vmax 1200. My 2nd day riding, I went down. 

It was an uphill curve, coming out to a dedicated lane over a bridge. The car in front of my slammed on their brakes for no reason. 

I was following maybe a little too closely, panicked and jerked my front brake real hard. I went flying over the handlebars and into the next lane of traffic. Due to the metric tons of adrenaline, I jumped straight up, ran over to my bike, picked it up, and ran to a nearby curb island.

Bike got a little dent on the faux tank cover, bent my shifter and handlebars, and I lost a metal ring at the end of my handle grip. I had a nasty bruise on my shin, and a scrape on my hand. 

It could have been *so so so* much worse. I didn't get hit by any oncoming traffic, I managed to not hit the person in front of me, and nobody hit my bike while it went down. 

So, I fixed the bike myself (minus the dent, haven't done that yet) and stuffed it into storage. It's been there for 3 years. Now it's at a buddy's shop, who just finished putting new tires and doing a general tune up and I pick it up in a few hours. I'm a little nervous, if I'm being honest with myself.

motorcycles,"I got a new bike (my first!) in May. I've put 2,700 miles on it since, just riding around where I live. It's safe to say I've been bitten hard by the riding bug.

This heat wave is killing any desire I have to ride, though. I'm an ATGATT Dad, and any thought of getting all my crap on to go for a ride evaporates just like my sweat doesn't as soon as I step outside every morning. Even at 6 am it's gross out.

motorcycles,"So, this is my first bike and I've only rode the last year and a half. this is the first time I've had to get a tire replaced. I have a '20 cbr300r.  I noticed last Thursday that my rear tire had worn to the point I was starting to see threads in multiple spots. I didn't feel comfortable riding it 40-60 minutes to a power sports place because our roads are terrible. Now, they mostly work on Harley's, but had told me previously they could do basic maintenance on it.  I called up friday asking if they could put a new tire on for me, gave them the specs and they said yeah bring it in. When I got up to the shop they said they'd have to special order it and it wouldn't be ready until Thursday.
Cool, no problems. Dropped the bike off and walked home.  

I pick it up today and the owner told me he put on a firmer tire that it would last longer and tightened up a couple things. I didn't know that he actually meant he put a different kind of bike tire on. When I had spoke to him on Thursday they essentially said the numbers after 140/70-17 don't really matter(66s). Now I've got on a me888 marathon ultra 140/80b17 69v.  I took off for work and thought it felt completely different. Maybe it's just the chain too tight, the suspension was tightened up, it's just that the tire is new?  But I had to get to work.  

It vibrates my ass and feet off, it takes much longer to get up to speed, I've lost about ~17mph off top speed, it feels like it's constantly rubbing and now my rear brakes are useless.

motorcycles,"I've been brought to my knees by a 5 mm socket head Allen bolt. I want to throw the caliper away or possibly the whole fucking bike.  

Tl;dr version: I tried a bunch of stuff to get the bolt out. Finally I drilled a larger hole, but the bolt extractor  just spins and spins when applied (drill set ccw).  What speed should the drill be set to? How powerful does the drill have to be? (I only have a dinky 12v cordless drill).

Detailed version below.

Background: the first turn of the wrench rounded out the socket. I've never had anything strip so fast in my life. The other pin immediately cracked loose, no problems, so I wasn't even worried about having issues. 

So far I have tried:

Hit it with WD-40 in case the bolt is seized.  

Attempted to use similar torx and SAE bits. Either way too big or way too small. 

Tried to turn bolt with twisted Allen key meant for semi stripped bolts. No purchase.

Glued Allen key into the socket with JB weld. Immediately sheared loose. 

Cleaned Allen key better with degreaser and retried. Immediately sheared loose.

Called shop to pay for this to all go away.  Was told the wait would be 6-8 weeks, call us back in two weeks. 

Considered every wretched moment of my life leading me to this. 

Hit it with PB Blaster.

Attempted to drill out a bigger hole and then use a reverse-threaded extractor bit (SpeedOut Pro from
 Lowes) to extract.  Heated area with mini heat gun for 7 minutes before extraction attempt. 

I succeeded in drilling a larger, cleaner hole, but the extractor bit just spins and spins. I think this might be a technique thing.  I haven't done anything similar before. What speed should the drill be set to? How powerful does the drill have to be? (I only have a dinky 12v cordless drill).

Not sure if its because I'm going 80+ in a hot climate or there's issues with my bike? 

So far, changed the radiator fan, changed the water pump and oil seal, changed coolant 

Any advice? Thanks!MT-03 Temps going to 4 bars?"
motorcycles,"Hey. 
Spent the last few weeks trying to find the best new helmet that fits right, as well as being able to fit a cardo kit with speakers.

Came across the Bell Broozer. Really liking the look of it and it fits me brilliantly. However, where the speakers could go are only very small dips, and I'm not allowed to test fit the speakers without buying the helmet. How am I supposed to test the fit if I'm not allowed to place the wiring inside and wear it for a bit? Surely others have gone through the process of finding a comm kit and a helmet, how did they do it?

I don't want to waste money on something that might not even be compatible. How can I achieve a true ""try before you buy"" ?",Need help regarding Cardo intercom fitting,"Hey.

What type of vest is the safest? It’s very hot where we live and it was 95 today. I don’t have a price point but all suggestions would help. 

Also I want him to have a body cam.. or a helmet cam? Any suggestions?

I'm gonna buy a limited 600-700cc Naked and today I went to the dealerships to test them out. (Not really to test them because I don't even have my license yet, still need to pass the circuit exam)

So I went to Kawasaki, Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha. I sat and took a closer look at Z650, Ninja 650, Z900, CBR650F, CB500R, SV650, MT07, MT09 and finally R7.

All Naked but for the Ninja and the R7.

So the Ninja felt pretty good, even tho it's not a naked it does feel like one with extra fairings due to the upright seating position and reachable handlebars.

The R7 tho. Man as soon as I sat on that thing my heart started pumping like crazy. It made me feel exactly how 10 year old me would have expected to feel.

It was a glorious moment AND I WAS ONLY SITTING ON A TURNED OFF BIKE.

If I had my wallet on me and my permit already I would have been pretty close to getting it on the spot.

Now I am in love with the bike.

And the problem is I know, my brain knows that it is the motorcycle I want but not the one that I need.
I'm looking for a bike to go to and from work, around 40 miles/day.
I know it will become uncomfortable and I am not planning on going to the mountain on weekends or going for track days. I need a commuter and this isn't it.

Still I am obsessed with it. I can't wait to test it out when I get my license but I know I need to get rid of this obsession before I go to finally buy one because if that moment was today, I would go for it.

motorcycles,"Alright, this is a weird one.

I got my bike serviced, where the mechanic changed the engine oil, spark plugs, air filter, and fuel filter; and they also cleaned the throttle body. 

The bike is running a lot better now, but I have noticed two weird problems that are bugging me. 

1. The revs don't come down as fast as they used to and sometimes it hangs near 4k for a second before dropping down

2. Engine braking has become weak - almost null - feels like riding a scooter.

My bike is fuel injected, so it is not badly tuned carb causing the issue. And I can't seem to find any explanation for this. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated, thank you.",Weird issue with my bike after service,"Alright, this is a weird one.

motorcycles,"I've recently noticed that my engine is bogging down.
It seems as if it's getting worse over time and it's really been bugging me lately, the most common instance of this is when I'm riding about at mid rpms and suddenly give it some gas to accelerate, if I give it just a little gas it will be really bad, bogging until I give it more gas or let off. If I open my throttle a bit more then it will bog and then ""get over it"".


If I open my throttle wide open it will do it for a second and then stop, and I can run through the gears no problems. 

Also if i rev at idle then it will sputter for the first few fires. 

The bike is a 1997 Yamaha virago 750, it's a carbureted v-twin, with 22,000 miles on it. 

I pulled the spark plugs, spark is good and gap is good
I checked the air filter, it was pretty clean, blew it out anyways, was a little bit of liquid what I assumed condensation in it. My only other guess is to check the fuel air mixture but I don't want to mess with my carbs. It also could be some stale gas in there from previous owner.

 The other reviews note that you should buy a size up, but some also say that it's kind of too tight either way.

When I finally cathed up to him I was putting myself on the right of the lane to kind of ask him if I could ride with him (you know when you ride with others you position yourselfs right, left, right left and so on).

He said yes! He put himself on the left of the lane and we rode together for like 10 minutes until we hit a intersection. I was going right and he was going left.

I nodded to him to say thanks for the ride as I was turning. I was focused on the traffic so I didn't see if he nodded back.

motorcycles,"Hi all! I’ve passed my full A license and as it was expected, I’m struggling to choose a 1st ride.

So as in taste, I’ve always wanted Steve McQueen’s Great Escape one haha I’ve had a look at the Royal Enfield Classic 350 and it’s gorgeous.

The thing is that I want a 650. I came across two other models that seem fairly similar: RE Interceptor 650 and Mash six hundred 650 classic. The looks of the Mash is exactly what I want, but doing some research, it looks like the interceptor is better and has a more support/popularity.

motorcycles,"So sadly totalled my FZ-09 2 months ago, blown tire followed by suspension rebound apparently. I don't remember the accident at all.

I was paying about $680 a year for full coverage + medical(btw I advise against this it has made the entire hospital stay and rehab a nightmare because Blue Cross would not give them the time of day because Progressive should be responsible).

Anyways medical story aside I originally wanted a Triumph but they're rare where I live so settled for the Yamaha triple.

Two Street RS's are currently for sale in my area a 2019 and a 2020, Progressive quoted me $630 which I expected slightly smaller engine would equal a small price drop.

For the Hell of it also quoted myself on an MT-10 and a Tuono V4 because there are quite a few in my area for right around $10K.

Tuono was only $432 and the MT-10 was $587???

My first bike was a 2021 MT07 and i had it for a lil over a month before it got stolen 2 weeks ago. The ins will cover some of the cost but I'm probably gonna lose some money. Anyway, i decided to look for a used street triple r and found a 2012 model with 5k miles. Ik the bike doesn't have abs so I'll have to get used to that. I test rode it yesterday and noticed that the shifts were harder in the higher gears compared to my MT07. I'm new to motorcycles but I'm thinking maybe the clutch cable had play so it wasn't filling engaging the clutch plate? Or maybe i wasn't too high in the rev range so it didn't want to shift up? I also found it difficult to shift into neutral. What do you guys think? Is this normal amongst triumphs?","hey guys, I'm going to purchase a 2012 street triple r with 5400 miles on it and need your advice on it",".

Hi all. Hope you’re all keeping well.

So I’m currently working part-time, meaning I have a lot of spare time on my hands. 

Big into motorcycles, I’m currently riding : 

Yamaha TDR125 PowerValve (2 Stroke) and the iconic European 2 stroke sports scooter (Peugeot Speedfight 2)

Nearly 8 months on the road so far, enjoying every moment of it.. 

I have a nice chunk of cash here, I’ve already bought really good gear, lovely yellow AGV helmet, racing boots, gloves and maintenance costs are covered on both of my bikes. 

I want to keep learning more about motorcycles, how to fix them up and make them look really nice.. would I be stupid to spend a bit of money modifying this scooter? I’m talking full repaint (I’ll do myself) for plastics, frame wheels.. add a few cool graphic sets to it, new headlights, might try and see if I can add forks to the front instead of its 1 sides suspension..

Colour I have in mind is Candy Apple Red/Ruby! 

Adding a bigger carb, upjets, an exhaust system (don’t think I’ll bother adding a big bore to it) seems like a waste for not much more top end speed (it’s air cooled)

Was also wondering is there a point buying project bikes and doing them up or is it a risky play? 

Thanks for viewing,

Few weeks ago I started my 2006 yamaha r6 after it hadn’t ran for about 5 days. Up till this point the bike had been running great for weeks day after day and didn’t have any issues. The bike started but idled funny and didn’t sound right. Long story short I put the bike in gear after letting it warm up for 10 mins but it died when going into first. After that the bike would start intermittently for a few seconds then die until it wouldn’t start at all. Since then I’ve completely charged the battery (relatively new with no issues) replaced spark plugs, rebuilt the fuel pump, replaced the fuel filter in the pump, changed oil, and I’m going to clean the air filter. When I had the fuel pump rebuilt the filter itself was all sorts of clogged up with crap which would (to me) explain why it ran poorly the last time it did start. Not sure where to go from here I suspect it may be a bad starter, starter relay or starter motor or even a faulty safety switch sensor. Tonight, after reinstalling the fuel pump and tank, the bike attempted to turn over but still wouldn’t start. Progress since the bike previously wouldn’t try to turn over at all, but still no start. Kinda sorta new to motorcycle maintenance and not exactly sure how to diagnose certain issues especially with the starter, safety switches or ecu.

Started off putting around on my brother's dirt bike when I was a little kid, YZ250 I think, and then back in 2009 I randomly signed up and took an MSF course at the local community college. A few months after that I ended up with probably not the best bike to start with... A 2003 Z1000, yep a liter bike. 

Had that for a few years, riding off an on but eventually sold it (for a profit!) when I needed some money and I wasn't riding around South Florida much on it as it was cause crazy drivers. 

Fast-forward to now. Three days ago I walked into my local dealer asking about the MT-07, bought it straight cash because there was already 5 folks with finance applications on it. Thing wasn't even on the showroom floor, but still in the crate. Surprisingly the dealership actually let me put the bulk of the purchase (~10k) on my debit card.

Next day I got the call that it was ready, Uber'd over and started shopping helmets and jackets. I spent a bit more than I wanted to, but a carbon fiber LS2 helmet and a Klim jacket with D3O armor is probably not a bad idea. Gonna shop for some riding boots and jeans on RevZilla soon.

motorcycles,"Hi all, 

Here for a bit of knowledge for anyone willing to help out. 

Background: Long time motorcycle rider, I’ve owned or shared Ducati monsters, 848 Evo Corse SE, Sport 1000S, Honda CBR 1000, 2011 BMW S1000RR as well as a variety of dirt bikes and scooters - and I cycle and mountain bike. So I spend a lot of time on two wheels 

All this being said, I leave maintenance of all these toys to qualified professionals, I know what I don’t know, and I know bugger all about maintaining most of these, aside from basic things. 

The bike in question - brand spanking new 2022 BMW S1000RR M sport (Ordered August 2021, delivered Feb 2022, only 1500k’s ridden so far due to torrential rain in Sydney for most of the year as well as work schedule, recently moved back to Melbourne) 

My question: What could the issue be with my bike set up or suspension that makes it super uncomfortable to ride for extended distances / times? 

Thus far I’ve done or changed the following: 
- Replaced plank-wood seat with a wunderlich sport (the original seat was super hard) 
- Gone from wearing jeans to exclusively leathers, to better grip the tank and sit back a bit (tank pads maybe coming soon) 
- Went to a motorcycle tuner / suspension set up shop today, discovered front shocks weren’t right, and rear shock needs to be replaced as not rated for my weight (sag is out apparently, I’ve just been doing research on what that means) the tuner managed to get the front as good as possible, and they are expensive to replace, but recommended replacing the rear 
- According to tuner in this shop (tunes all types of bikes + racers) standard front and rear shocks on my bike only rated up to 70kg rider - I’m 95kg 

What do I mean by uncomfortable:
- Really rough ride, over bumps / bridges anything not super smooth 
- Sore groin and family jewels after more than 45 minutes riding, trying to work on riding position but feel like I’m always sliding forward into tank  - for perspective I could and did ride the 848 evo 8+ hours in one go  between cities multiple times stopping only for fuel and food 
- Going downhill / cornering downhill feels horrendous, it sounds like the bike was really leaning forward / facing down if that makes sense 
- Was riding in ‘road’ mode, now using dynamic which firmed everything up a bit

All this being said, I leave maintenance of all these toys to qualified professionals, I know what I don’t know, and I know bugger all about maintaining most of these, aside from basic things. 

The bike in question - brand spanking new 2022 BMW S1000RR M sport (Ordered August 2021, delivered Feb 2022, only 1500k’s ridden so far due to torrential rain in Sydney for most of the year as well as work schedule, recently moved back to Melbourne) 

My question: What could the issue be with my bike set up or suspension that makes it super uncomfortable to ride for extended distances / times? 

Thus far I’ve done or changed the following: 
- Replaced plank-wood seat with a wunderlich sport (the original seat was super hard) 
- Gone from wearing jeans to exclusively leathers, to better grip the tank and sit back a bit (tank pads maybe coming soon) 
- Went to a motorcycle tuner / suspension set up shop today, discovered front shocks weren’t right, and rear shock needs to be replaced as not rated for my weight (sag is out apparently, I’ve just been doing research on what that means) the tuner managed to get the front as good as possible, and they are expensive to replace, but recommended replacing the rear 
- According to tuner in this shop (tunes all types of bikes + racers) standard front and rear shocks on my bike only rated up to 70kg rider - I’m 95kg 

What do I mean by uncomfortable:
- Really rough ride, over bumps / bridges anything not super smooth 
- Sore groin and family jewels after more than 45 minutes riding, trying to work on riding position but feel like I’m always sliding forward into tank  - for perspective I could and did ride the 848 evo 8+ hours in one go  between cities multiple times stopping only for fuel and food 
- Going downhill / cornering downhill feels horrendous, it sounds like the bike was really leaning forward / facing down if that makes sense 
- Was riding in ‘road’ mode, now using dynamic which firmed everything up a bit 

Sorry for wall of text, appreciate any info or ideas on how to resolve these issues - thanks2022 BMW S1000RR - Front / Rear suspension set up + sag question"

I'm planning on buying a 250 cc bike as an upgrade, I'm looking for the gixxer 250 or gixxer 250 SF (the version with sport fairing).

When going to work i have to go around the foot of a hill and I take a lot of wind from the sides, i can even feel the air moving the handlebar when turning, and i wonder if having a bike with fairing would add more resistance and make it worse or if it will improve the handling.

So i want to read what kind of experiences you have had with those kind of bikes",Question about experiences with small sport bikes on windy roads.,"Hi everyone.

motorcycles,"I’ve seen a lot of post asking how to deal with the heat and everyone says drink water of course. But don’t just drink some on the breaks of your ride or after. 

Pre hydrate: drink plenty of water throughout the day if it’s gonna be hot. You want to have the water in reserve because it’s hard to catch back up

Hydrate: stop and drink water while riding or have a camelback. I live in Texas and it’s been about 108-110. I can sweat out a full bottle in 15-30 minutes. That’s why you have to have a reserve and then constantly be drinking

Re hydrate: I drink at minimum two bottles after I get done riding but never stop really, this will slowly turn into your pre hydrating also.

Saw a post about a guy who soaked himself in water for home and was completely dry, that means you aren’t drinking enough water if your clothes don’t even have a bit of sweat on them. By constantly pre hydrating, hydrating, and re hydrating I’m able to work outside and still go on 2+ hours almost everyday without feeling sluggish or way to hot",As dumb as it sounds drink more water to deal with the heat.

motorcycles,"I know it's a super common question it's just hard to find someone else with the exact same issue. I bought a bike from a friend, its only 20yo and he just had it sitting so there weren't any real issues with it. So far I've trickle charged the battery a few times, opened the carbs and found them completely - I mean completely - spotless, replaced the fuel filter, oil filter and oil, and only used ethanol free gas with a little bottle of that cleaner additive stuff. 

So I'd say I'm doing pretty good haha. My only concern is that when I cold start it in the mornings its always a little rough and sometimes I only get the first chance to turn over and rev it into starting or it will be more difficult and might not start. I've also noticed the choke doesn't really help, I really never use it. Once I'm on the road though, it's always fine.

What's the problem here?

The jackets made for women are way to short in the sleeves. It doesn't help If I go up a size, then it just gets to big while the sleeves are still to short. The men's jackets doesn't really work either, to small over the hips and I look like a American football player. Of like 10 of 15 jackets I tried only two was even remotely close to fitting me and both made for men (which I don't mind they looked cool.) I haven't tried any pants yet but I imagine the same problem will occur.

The second problem that also happened while trying our gear was how I was treated by the staff. He, the staff guy, came up to me and my dad (who does not ride) and asked if we needed help. And during the entire time he was talking he was looking only at my dad talking directly to him. At one moment he even had his back turned towards me while talking to my dad.  All of this while it was very clear that I'm the one getting gear since I was the one trying things out.

motorcycles,Hi I have a 2013 ninja 300 and I was taking a look at the air filter to upgrade to the k&amp;n filter. Then I realized that there was a decent amount of oil absorbed in the stock filter.

motorcycles,"19m and I totaled my first bike 19 days after buying it brand new. Ninja 400 ABS. Took a blind corner too fast. Probably could have just turned harder, but I straightened up and braked and hit a tree head on. I'm an idiot. Front forks bent back so far the front wheel was rubbing the exhaust pipes. Everything in front of the mirrors is fucked. Insurance deemed it a total loss. I have total loss coverage so they'll pay me back what I payed the dealer minus a big chunk of their fees. 

I don't really know what to do now. I got it to use as my only vehicle, yeah that was dumb too. I think I'll be short about 2-3k compared to before I bought the bike, so I'm not in a position to get a new vehicle any time soon. So here's my main question, would it be worth it to buy it back from the insurance company and fix only what's necessary? The repair estimate listed a lot of things that didn't look like they absolutely needed fixing and I'm thinking I could get by just replacing the forks and headlamps and a few other things and be way below their estimate of $5k.

motorcycles,"Hi all,

Hoping to get some clarity about oil changes. First bike and have owned it for 2 months - it's a 2018 R3 and I bought it with 200km. I put 1000km and the OIL word is now flashing. I read online that Yamaha's first 1k KM means that it needs to have the oil changed. Dealer told me they changed the oil when I bought it and I am reading online that oil should be replaced every 2.5-5k. 

I am wondering how do you know if this is a legit oil change that needs to happen vs the oil indicator coming on for no reason? Seems odd to change oil at 1km but idk if this is a bike thing. 

Apparently with the R3 the oil trip meter has to be reset after the oil change or it will give an inaccurate change oil indicator. Not sure if this is the case for it but don't want to risk riding if it's true. I have an appointment to change the oil but can't ride for 1-2 weeks until I can get the bike in. 

Wondering what other R3 owners and experienced riders think and know about this.

Apparently with the R3 the oil trip meter has to be reset after the oil change or it will give an inaccurate change oil indicator. Not sure if this is the case for it but don't want to risk riding if it's true. I have an appointment to change the oil but can't ride for 1-2 weeks until I can get the bike in. 

Wondering what other R3 owners and experienced riders think and know about this.

THanks,

motorcycles,"I went in to cycle gear to find a helmet that fits me well. I ended up buying the Sedici Sistema 2 Modular size M. I measured the circumference of my head and it’s 55-56cm. So this size should be fine. 

However, it is so incredibly difficult to put it on and take it off. It’s always pulling my hair and my skin (and yes, I’m pulling the straps as I put it on to create more space, but that doesn’t do much). Additionally, I wore it in the house for like 20 minutes and it just felt uncomfortable due to it being tight

Couple criteria…

- Must be leather. Something that is formal enough to wear for most occasions, but robust enough to stand up to daily activities. Feminine but badass… she’s a classy kind of a cowgirl. 
- Something she can wear all day at work. Mostly admin/desk job but she ends up walking around the building a lot. The other day she had 14,000 steps!
- Good sole for traction while walking and more importantly maneuvering the bike. Oil traction is a plus.
- Good wear life so they can last a long time. Bonus if they can be re-soled. 
- Price isn’t too big of a deal as these will be used a lot and hopefully have a long life.

I rode it up to 100mph on the hour drive home and felt no extra vibrations, no pulsation with braking, shifted cleanly. Took it home and looked it over extra close compared to before riding home- no obvious issues with electrical, chain intact not even loosened, brakes working, even my left side handlebar and grip weren't even scratched. 

The damage I did see: 

* left side front &amp; left side back fairings scratched
* shifter was bent in
* left front turn signal scratches on plastic
* left mirror backing small scratch

Took it to my local dealership last week just to have a trained set of eyes look at it and see how much they thought the cosmetics would cost, just called today for an update and the service/technician report estimates my $9k MSRP bike to have...... **$11k in damage**. She started naming off what he listed and... idk if the technician didn't even look at my bike but it's dishonest af. 

From what she said before I cut her off because I couldn't deal with the bs anymore \[my response to their claims in brackets\]:

* Left AND right side fairings AND seat \[right side fairings were not damaged, neither was the seat, I have a photo and it's in perfect condition..\]
* Forks \[I laid it down, no frontal collision at all\]
* Chain \[maybe chain damage I missed? the gravel was bigger rocks... but I still find it unlikely\]
* Handlebars \[unless theres some mechanical thing that wouldn't be obvious while riding they're fine\]
* Swingarm \[I have photos, my swingarm maybe has a small scratch? Nothing more\]

(this is where I was fed up and said I need to talk to this dude in person I'll be by later)

* Passenger peg damage on left side only **\[I removed both side passenger pegs a while ago\]**
* All turn signals \[No?? just no?\]

I'll be going by later and I'm a bold guy so I don't mind calling him out on his BS when he walks me through every item on his report, and I'm gonna make sure he reads out loud every single thing he listed so I can call him out on each piece. The only thing I was really worried about was the bent shifter and maybe if the seal was damaged. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Why do you think he would report this much damage, even if I wanted to go through insurance (which I won't) there's no way they would approve these damages once they saw pictures, so I don't get what the end game is, trick me into agreeing to a price and then paying more than the bike is worth out of pocket to a service guy when my insurance denies the claim? 

And I'll need a new shifting lever for sure but now I don't know if I even trust them? Would you let them order your shifting lever and replace it or just take it to a non-dealership mechanic altogether?

Am also 26M and don't live life with regrets, I'm sure you guys can relate.How long can you give up riding?"
motorcycles,Tonight I was riding like normal and after a very quick acceleration my back break totally gave out with no prior sign of problems. I pulled over immediately to see if the rotor had fallen of or something crazy and it visually was completely normal. I turned it off let it sit and the breaks felt spongey for a bit but than back to normal. Did they overheat or something?

Let me start this off by saying I’ve read a lot of posts regarding tall riders and what are the better choice for bikes. However, I can’t seem to find a similar situation that I’m in. 

As the title says I’m 6’8” but what my issues is I’m long in the torso not the legs (32” inseam) so while there are plenty of good suggestions for longer legged riders my issue the wind sail of a torso I have. With that being said as much as I would love a sport bike, I have accepted that it’s likely not possible unless I get a custom made bike of some sort. So I’m thinking more realistically along the line of a cruiser or adventure sport/touring (Which I also really like as well).

It seems to me a possibility would be a cruiser of some description with a mild raised handle (ape hanger) or something similar…Is there any “out of the box” bikes that have a lower seat height and higher handle ratio ? 

Thanks again everyone !

motorcycles,"TL;DR: Do I need a bigger bike than a 400cc, or a tune up?

I did my motorcycle safety course to exit to my full license last week. Monday was the in class/parking lot session, and Thursday was the road test. I've had my [1982 Suzuki GS400L](https://i.imgur.com/WR16wrI.jpeg) for about 5 years now, and was going to use this bike for the testing. 

As I was riding home from the parking lot test on Monday, I was about a km (half a mile) from home, and as I pulled in my clutch to upshift

\*SNAP*

my clutch cable was done. 

As you can guess, trying to find a replacement clutch cable for a 40 year old bike within 48 hours was not an easy feat, and I was not able to even get something rush shipped in time. 

I ended up borrowing my friend's Suzuki Boulevard S40 (650cc) to be able to still make my road test on Thursday (and passed). When I was riding the bigger bike, I immediately noticed how much easier it would get up to highway speeds, when I'd have the throttle pinned on my GS and just be inching past 100km/h.

That being said, I am an idiot. In the 5 years I have had this bike, my total maintenance has been:
- oil change
- emptying the gas at the end of the season
- running some carb cleaner/fuel line conditioner in the gas tank when things got laggy
- replacing the Battery
- replacing the clutch cable

I'm still pretty new to motorcycles, so I'm not sure if maybe I just need to learn more and turn some wrenches and thats why my bike has a harder time than the S40, or if I just need to get a bigger bike. 

Right now, I mostly use my bike to go to work when its nice out and go on some rural rides, but long term I'd like to get something that I can do those things with, but also use it for longer trips and use the highways more often.

They are a more experienced rider, but they were on a much smaller bike than they're used to. They assumed I was going to stop and wait for traffic to pass, so they dropped their bike in the turn. It stalled when they didn't give enough gas for how fast they let out the clutch.

They were very upset and I felt bad for them and their new bike, so I gave a bit less than half the cost of a replacement fairing since it wasn't too expensive and they seemed in bad spirits.

We're at urgent care now to see if they broke their toe, and while waiting I implied that I have ridden with people where it would have been fine to make that left turn, so we must have had a misunderstanding. They said the people I rode with before were retarded and now we're not talking.

Decided to go on the highway and was cruising, running fine for roughly another 20 miles, then I transitioned from a 45 to a 65 and it shifted smoothly with no problems, until I got to speed and decelerated a little and the bike suddenly lost power (shifted in 6th gear prior like 5-10 minutes ago with no issues). It slowly crept down in speed even while giving it throttle until the bike came to a stop, but didn’t stall even while idling in 1st gear (100% certain it wasn’t in neutral). It also was able to be pushed around while in gear and wouldn’t stall and stayed idle (like it’s in neutral but it’s not it’s in 1st gear, 2nd gear, etc...). When I pulled off to a safe place you could feel the clutch biting (engaging) and would even slightly nudge forward. You could shift through the gears still but it would never get power to the rear wheel. When I put it on the center kickstand it would shift through all the gears and the rear tire was spinning like it was working normally, however when you placed it back on the ground it wouldn’t move.

A kind gentleman came by while I waited for my friend's to get my van and said he believes I blew up the clutch.

Hello, about 4 months ago I got my bike license. Now I've run into a problem that my finger joints are starting to hurt like crazy due to the vibrations, I'm currently in the process of trying different motorcycles. On my current one I have the thicker foam grips which help a little. But when I had a test drive on another bike the other day (new bmw F900R) my fingers hurt like crazy and it lasts around 2 days.  
So im looking for everything that will help me combat this problem. So here's my question if anyone has any experience with these Olympia Gel Gloves? Or if they know of any other brands that have gloves that somewhat reduce vibrations. 

If I ever want to daily a motorcycle I really cant have this problem, so the search for things that help continues and a motorcycle that has very low vibrations (besides electric..)

Thank you!","Any experience with the Olympia 715 GEL gloves? (Arthritis problem, looking for solution)","&amp;#x200B;

motorcycles,"I just purchased a used Harley Sportster Forty Eight with about 13k miles on it, coming from a Kawasaki Vulcan 500, which was my first bike.

After purchasing the Harley I went for a ride and went all of about 5 miles before my clutch stopped engaging. After further inspection it seemed like the clutch was significantly more touchy than my Kawasakis and even a bit of pressure would engage it, as little as a bit more pressure than me resting my hand on it, and this led me to be partially engaging it for a few miles, this being a brand new bike to me I didn’t even notice until it was too late. 

My question is if this would be enough to burn out the entire clutch or if there was likely a lot of wear on it already and I just finished it off? I brought it back to the dealership for them to work on it and they believe it is my fault, which I know partially it is because you could smell the clutch had burned when they opened it up.

motorcycles,"Hi guys,

At a bit of a loss here - I’m looking for GSX750F luggage rack for my 1996. I’ve found one on eBay but it’s nearly £200 which seems a bit expensive.

Been looking around for a few weeks and found one on bikeluggage.co.uk for £85 which seems a bit more reasonable, but it’s for a ‘98 - ‘02 model. After contacting them they can’t confirm if it would fit on my ‘96.

motorcycles,"I’ve been riding solidly in the street for a good two months now, using a 2005 BMW f650 gs retired police bike. It’s a good bike and I’m comfortable and confident on it, however it belongs to my mom who’s letting me borrow it while I learn. Seeing as I want my own bike eventually, I did quite a bit of research based on how I ride and would like to ride in the future, and have concluded that a Ninja 400 seems like a pretty good fit for me.

My concern however, is that my mom advises against having a specialized like that as a first purchase, with her reasoning that such a bike is uncomfortable for longer rides, and that eventually I’ll want a larger size anyway. She suggested particularly a Honda CB500F, or similarly styled bikes. Basically she says that if I just jump into a ninja 400 now, that I’ll end up regretting the purchase later on.

Under normal circumstances I’d take her advice into account but ultimately do my own thing anyway, however she’s been riding and racing for 35+ years, both professional and otherwise, while I’ve got a couple of months in the street and a couple of years in the dirt. Moreover, her previous bike was a 2007 Ninja 650r, so her comment on ride position is not without merit.

motorcycles,"So after 9 years of riding, I had a big one.  It was mostly my fault due to a stupid decision driven by fatigue :(  On the 6th day of a 7 day solo touring trip from PA to NC (something that I've done twice before), I decided to make a dodgy pass past multiple cars and one of the cars in the lane pulled to make a left turn and just barely clipped the rear of my bike, but that destabilized the bike enough that I went down hard on my right side.  

6 broken ribs, broken clavicle (collar bone), fractured scapula (shoulder blade), partially collapsed lung on my right side from slamming into the ground.  I was wearing full gear, so it could have been a lot worse; I only had tiny patch of road rash on my shoulder where I took of the impact and my jacket tore.  No damage to legs, feet, hands, spine, head. Based on the damage to my full face helmet, I wouldn't have much of a face left had I not been wearing one.  Still spent 5 days in hospital, and surgery to put a plate on my clavicle, and I'm going to be in pain for at least 2 months from the ribs.  3 weeks later I haven't had more than 4 hours continuous sleep since the accident, but I'm actually pretty much functional for daily life.  I already have quite good range of motion on my right arm, just can't lift more than like 2lbs.  I should make a full recovery in time.

I love riding, but I don't ever want to go through something like this again.  I crashed in VA, 5 hours away from family or friends that could help me.  I don't know that I'm ready to give up riding entire, but I might be done touring.  Maybe in a year or two I'll like a nice little &lt;=500cc  bike and be content just riding around my area.

From my research the biggest factors I have seen where the riding position, where the power band lies in the RPM, and price.

I wanted to confirm these along with any other things I should be thinking about with getting a bike like this.

What I use my bike for now is commuting to and from work(about 15-20minutes), and everyday joyriding. I like that I get better MPG than my Fusion and its obviously much more enjoyable.

I am worried about the seating position of the 600RR, Is it really that leaned forward to where its uncomfortable? I don't mind my 500r seating position at all and find myself leaning forward more often than not. I am a 5'9 athletic male if that makes a difference on seating.

I have also been wondering if I would even use the 600RR to even a little bit of its potential just because of how high ""strung"" it is. On the highway I obviously have fun but I like having my license. Just based on this is it worth it to get a 600RR or should I just go with a 650RR as I would be in the powerband range more often anyway?

last thought I had is am I even in the right realm? should I be looking at 650R? or should I be shifting to a R7? Any advice is welcome as I am having a hard time as I don't know as much about these bikes.

motorcycles,"Hi all.
I am a firefighter in Canada. Over the last little while I've noticed an uptick in bike accidents. Being a rider of 10 years myself, it's easy to let judgement slide in on each of these calls. ""I would have done this, too bad he did that"" etc.

A few days ago I responded to a highway accident. I have seen my fair share of death and unfortunately, my fair share of fatal bike accidents. However, without getting into too much detail, this particular call stuck with me. He was in my opinion the most broken patient I'd ever responded to.

I don't know exactly what happened, but I do know it wasn't his fault. And maybe that's why it stuck with me. He was young, had a young family, and was commuting as he'd probably done everyday this and previous riding seasons. It appeared as though a distracted driver did not slow down when traffic did. His bike ended up 50 feet from nowhere directly in line with the place of impact, almost within the same lane of what I can only assume was his starting point. 

My partner, myself, and the medics did our best to bring the gentleman back, but clearly he was needed somewhere else more than he was with us.

The point of this is that, while I know lane filtering is categorized as dangerous riding by police, I urge everyone to do one of two things. 

1. Check your mirrors all the God damn time 
2. Don't listen to music in any amount of traffic
3. If in slow traffic or stopped, ride the shit out of the dotted line so if a car fucks up and doesn't brake when going 120km/h, it will hopefully miss you and hit the car in front.

Stay safe everyone! Sorry for the lengthy post and my absolute greatest of condolences to the family should anyone related read this.",A Firefighter with a Motorcycle and a PSA,"Hi all.
I am a firefighter in Canada. Over the last little while I've noticed an uptick in bike accidents. Being a rider of 10 years myself, it's easy to let judgement slide in on each of these calls. ""I would have done this, too bad he did that"" etc.

A few days ago I responded to a highway accident. I have seen my fair share of death and unfortunately, my fair share of fatal bike accidents. However, without getting into too much detail, this particular call stuck with me. He was in my opinion the most broken patient I'd ever responded to.

I don't know exactly what happened, but I do know it wasn't his fault. And maybe that's why it stuck with me. He was young, had a young family, and was commuting as he'd probably done everyday this and previous riding seasons. It appeared as though a distracted driver did not slow down when traffic did. His bike ended up 50 feet from nowhere directly in line with the place of impact, almost within the same lane of what I can only assume was his starting point. 

My partner, myself, and the medics did our best to bring the gentleman back, but clearly he was needed somewhere else more than he was with us.

The point of this is that, while I know lane filtering is categorized as dangerous riding by police, I urge everyone to do one of two things. 

1. Check your mirrors all the God damn time 
2. Don't listen to music in any amount of traffic
3. If in slow traffic or stopped, ride the shit out of the dotted line so if a car fucks up and doesn't brake when going 120km/h, it will hopefully miss you and hit the car in front.

motorcycles,"I have a 2018 gold wing tour dct. The rear tire is a 200 which is very stiff. I have never changed a tire before, but I'm pretty handy. I have read all about the fun it will be (sarcastic) without a dedicated tire changer. I was very close to buying a no mar tire changer for 5 or 6 hundred dollars when I thought to myself it would be a bad investment. I will only use it to change the tires when needed on that bike, which will not be too often. I am also sick of paying a shop and taking them there , then waiting and going back to pick them up

I did a lot of research and pretty much know what I'm in for. I have the new tires. I originally bought one of those harbor freight tire changers with the bead breaker for $40. My plan was to get the  HF motorcycle attachment and mod it to work well  for what I need, like many have done. But, they discontinued it. So, I think I will be able to break the bead, but I need a way to hold the wheel while mounting and dismounting the new tires. I also bought a mojo lever and some lube plus an assortment of spoons and rim savers, and a yellow thing tool. I know there is a lot of force required to mount the 200 GW tire cause it is so stiff. My only concern is keeping it still. I planned on getting a rod/pipe at Home depot to put through the center and figure something out. Maybe put something inside the wheel to keep it from turning on my bench. It would have to not stick up obviously so I can use the lever. I looked at those round tire changing stands (like the ones form bikemaster, HF, tusk, etc  that also have the bead breaker to hold it, but I don't see those working.  So I'm looking for ideas.

I was watching some Doug Demuro videos about Alpina BMWs and it got me wondering if there are any Alpina bikes out there?

I know the M1000rr exists so if the M division makes bikes, maybe so does Alpina?

Appearently there is an electric bycicle style bike out there that was made by Alpina, but i couldn't find anything about motorcycles :/",Do BMW Alpina bikes exist?,"Hey guys :D

2021 Ninja 400


Both similar milage and same price(4500USD), the gpx is Street legal dual sport which I really like but I am worried about the reliability of a gpx. Another thing is I think if I wanted to I could flip the ninja 400 for a profit so I am stuck on what I shoudl do.

Is the gpx reliable enough to put a lot of miles on? I think I would enjoy a supermoto being around Boone NC(App Student). I think the Ninja 400 would also be super fun on the roads but can't take it off road ofc.

What are yall's thoughts? Very much appreciated!!! I'm trying to make a smart decision!",I am a 19yo looking for a bike for college right now and have narrowed it to two choices.,"2021 gpx moto fse450r

motorcycles,"Hey guys, I see a lot of new riders posts everyday so I wanted to add my 2 cents on things you may not see in every other post.

1. If your riding an unfamiliar road and can’t see over the crest of a hill. Power lines can give you a good idea of where the road goes. Generally power lines run along side roads but not always.

2. If you have 2 separate headlights and ride in the dark, cars think you’re another car 100yds further down the road than you are.

3. Stretch. Seriously, this may be my biggest tip. Take 5 minutes to stretch everyday even if you don’t ride. Your legs and lower back will thank you.

4. You can actually charge your phone off your motorcycle. It’s an easy connection to the batter, stores under the seat, and is very helpful when you’re going on a ride and forgot to charge your phone.

Feel free to add other untalked about tips in the comments, ride safe guys. :)",Some untalked about tips for new riders.,"Hey guys, I see a lot of new riders posts everyday so I wanted to add my 2 cents on things you may not see in every other post.

I tried to jump start it as you can see in the video (only had it hooked up to the car for a few minutes) but it still won’t go.

motorcycles,"Brief overview: I ride dirt bikes (technically dual sports but I rarely ride on the road) and my friend is interested in getting into the hobby after seeing how much fun it is. 

He’s since been asking my opinion on a good first bike. I’ve felt generally able to give good advice, but now he’s been asking me about the Zero FXS and I’m really not sure whether it’s a good choice since I’ve never ridden an electric motorcycle. 

Here are the pros I see to the Zero (or really any electric motorcycle) as a first bike:

1. Don’t have to worry about learning to shift while you learn to ride. Not sure whether this is actually a pro, but it seems to be a big one from his perspective (any sort of manual transmission is intimidating to him).

2. It’s light and should be relatively easy to handle. 


Here are the cons I see:

1. Instant electric torque is probably insanely fun for a rider with some experience, but I’d be a little concerned about it being too much for a novice. 

2. Dropping your first bike is a virtual certainty, and the Zero is pricey relative to a gas powered bike of the same size. The friend in question can easily afford it, but still seems worth noting.

3. Don’t have to learn how to shift. Like I said above, not sure if this is a good thing since he’ll be limited to electric (or otherwise automatic) bikes until he learns to shift. 


Other Relevant Info:

Range doesn’t matter for him, he’s not gonna take it on a road trip. Just some fun in the dirt and maybe some short commutes.

I’d like to ride around my town at night to try and get comfortable on the roads around me without the hordes of daytime traffic. However- I know riding at night can be more risky. 

Night time: Less visibility, more roaming wildlife, drunk drivers, less personal visibility, less people around to help if something goes wrong. 

Daytime: hot as balls, more visibility, more traffic, anxiety, everything else basically. 

But- In my town, when the sun is shining there’s a lot of traffic. And right now with the heat I feel like my mind is too distracted during the daytime. Once it hits 8:30pm, the town dies basically.

motorcycles,"I ride a 1999 yamaha yzf R6 it is equipped with a 599cc 5EB series motor 

Today I had my bike out on the highway and gave her some real juice, I came home and a few hours later I went out again, the motor had fully cooled and I checked the oil before starting it, some of the oil had been burned (no worries I thought, its an old bike and I was kind of tramping on her) so I added some oil to bring it back to the optimal level and went on my merry way. I always let my bike warm up to 140°F at least. So with optimal oil level, a nicely pre heated motor, I set off. Not 30 seconds down the road the oil light comes on, I pull over right away and turn the bike off (using the kill switch) the oil light stays on. I then turned the key all the way off and then after a few seconds, back on, the oil light then turned off,  I checked the oil right there on the side of the road and it was BONE DRY. So with an elevated heartrate I waited a few minutes for the oil to fully settle and checked it again, this time is was looking better but it had some bubbles in it. Not thinking much I turned the bike back on, no oil light, I continued on my ride and it felt fine. I got home like an hour later and noticed the fender was covered in coolant, the water pump case was also covered in coolant (it was leaking from a little hose coming out the side of the water pump case)

I then turned the key all the way off and then after a few seconds, back on, the oil light then turned off,  I checked the oil right there on the side of the road and it was BONE DRY. So with an elevated heartrate I waited a few minutes for the oil to fully settle and checked it again, this time is was looking better but it had some bubbles in it. Not thinking much I turned the bike back on, no oil light, I continued on my ride and it felt fine. I got home like an hour later and noticed the fender was covered in coolant, the water pump case was also covered in coolant (it was leaking from a little hose coming out the side of the water pump case) 

So. Thats my story, thanks for reading. Please leave a comment with any speculations as to potential causes. Thank youweird r6 issues need help"

motorcycles,"So I am pretty new to motorcycling, I have not gotten my A1 (bikes up to 125cc) license yet, but have taken many lessons and probably will get the license this summer. I have been thinking what kind of bike to get. I am really short (161/5'3) so many bikes, even these smaller ones tend to have too tall seat to stand still with the bike comfortably. I would like to have a seat height, that feels more comfortable and is easier to stand with even longer periods of time. 

There is choppers in the 125cc category, and I really like how they look, but they don't have ABS. They are usually older too, usually made in 90's or some in early 2000. I really like Honda Rebel 125, but there are these minuses that the bike's top speed is about 95kmh/58mph and no ABS. I would like the bike to go over 100kmh/60mph and would like to safer brakes. I am chubby and my weight will slow the bike a bit, so on the Rebel 90kmh/55mph would be maybe the max speed... 

Then there are these newer bikes out there, such as Keeway RKF 125. It has ABS, it's top speed is around 120kmh/70mph and it's pretty cheap on price. The older ones are cheaper, because of the age and kilometers they have on them, but over all they have extra price because of the looks and age. The minus with these bikes is the seat height. The bike I use when learning to ride has seat height that people tend to say is short (78cm/31inch) which is high for me. I can get on the bike fine, but standing still for longer periods of time starts to hurt my leg/s, since I usually have to tip toe very hardly with both feet or then put one feet on the ground and hold the bike's weight and my own weight with one leg. 

So the question is, which one is better? Having a bike that looks real nice to me and is really comfortable to ride, but has normal brakes and is slower OR a bike that looks decent, has ABS, is faster but has high seat?",Is it better to have lower seat height motorcycle with normal brakes or higher seat and ABS?,"So I am pretty new to motorcycling, I have not gotten my A1 (bikes up to 125cc) license yet, but have taken many lessons and probably will get the license this summer.

I need my biker mates to ensure my point and really get this through to his head. It is not safe to get on a motorcycle with that mindset. It's just asking for trouble.

I need my biker mates to ensure my point and really get this through to his head. It is not safe to get on a motorcycle with that mindset. It's just asking for trouble. If he claims this to his CBT instructor, he will more than likely have to fail him to protect his life, but he doesn't understand. 

Please, I'm really worried about him. The more comments the better. If he won't believe me, maybe he'll believe tons and tons of bikers who share my point. This could save him from his own unrealistic expectations of motorcycle riding. 

Many thanks all.I'm concerned for my friend starting to ride a motorcycle."
motorcycles,My stepfather has tragically passed in a motorcycle accident and he had a bell on the lowest point of his bike. That being said I am unsure of traditions on what should come of this Bell. Can anyone help me understand what I need to do or not do with the bell.

motorcycles,"Hey everyone! 

  
I'm asking for help, because I got stuck with this carb issue. 

  
The bike we are talking about is a 1995, Yamaha Virago XV 535.

  
It cold-started nicely, idled and ran fine until it got warm. When the engine reached the operating temperature it started choking and popping between idle and higher RPMs ( this happened around \~1/8 - 1/4 throttle), but once it got above this range it ran fine again.   
After hours of digging through service manuals and forums evertyhing pointed into the direction of a clogged pilot jet. I took the carbs apart and gave them a good clean (but they weren't even dirty in the first place ! Both of them was clean and dry, no gunk, no metal shavings, no bad fuel residue, nothing. Good as new.) Sealings and O-rings are not broken, not cracked. All the jets are clean, I can clearly see through every one of them.   
After this I went to the otherside of the carbs and checked the diaphragm. (If not the jets, then maybe the diaphragms. They have been replaced 2 years ago, but who knows...) The diaphragms are looking flawless, factory condition. Put them back together, because I couldn't see any obvious issues and continued to search for the root of the problem.

I started adjusting the air-fuel mixture screw as well: I turned it all the way in, then 2 full rotations out and from there I tried to find the point where the RPM rises and the bike idles nicely (found it around 3,5-4 rotations out).  
I checked the sync of the carbs: they were off-balance a bit, but nothing serious. Adjusted them, but it didn't solve the issue either.  

After these, I took the bike for a test ride after (I thought maybe the disassembly + reassembly of the carbs + the synchronization + the air-fuel mixture adjusment might have changed something). But nope, or in fact it got slightly worse :( \~5 minutes into the ride I had to stop at a red light and I wasn't able to pull off. The bike will start and idle, but when I touch the throttle (even the slightest) it stalls. I had to push it back home.  

And this is where I'm at right now: The bike will start. Until it's cold it even runs fine. After it gets warm it will run poorly (mainly around low RPMs) and once I need to go to a full stop, put it in neutral, I won't be able to make it roll again. It will idle, but as soon as I touch the throttle, the bike stalls.  


 Any ideas what to do ?

motorcycles,"TL;DR: should I just buy new to get the bike I want and only spend a little more, or should I just keep looking until I can find something used for a good price to learn? 

So I'm taking my MSF course the weekend of August 8th. Already have a helmet, gloves, boots, and a jacket on the way. I've been wanting to start riding for a few years but life will be life. Anyway, I'm able to take the class and buy a motorcycle now. I thought to myself I'd do what every kid does when buying a car, but a cheap beater on Craigslist or FB marketplace and abuse that for a few months until I'm confident enough to buy a new bike. Here's the problem, any bike I can find for under $1500 doesn't run or has other issues. Bikes around $2000 are in bad condition and most of them are 600cc or more. I can't seem to find a good starter bike for less than $2500 that is ready to go. Also, my state requires titles and most people don't have titles, so that narrows my options down a lot. I've already looked at a few, brought my uncle who can ride with me, and they've all been garbage. Since I can get a new bike that I actually want for $5k, I've been thinking after the class, I'll just get a new bike. I'm between the V Star 250 and the RE Meteor 350, both under $5k. I'm sure out the door price will be north of $5k, but that's not an issue. I'd buy used for $5k to get a good bike, but why do that when I can just buy new and have a warranty?

motorcycles,"Hey all,

I made my bike as ergonomic as possible and I also ride it the way it is supposed to be ridden in terms of body shape, arm positioning etc. I find that after a while of riding my wrist, hand and fingers start becoming tired and fatigued after 1h of non-stop riding. Not sure if this is considered a long time but I want to do some roadtrips in the future and am worried that this will get in the way.

Do you guys have this issue too? It's mostly my right hand that I am referring to with all the throttle moving and braking. Again, I positioned the brake lever to be ergonomic and ride in the proper position. Bike is an R3. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of R3 fuel consumption - hard to find a hard number on the net but how many total kms will an R3 go for from a full tank to empty?
